# Markdown

Docsify supports various types of rich text using markdown.

This text contains *italics*, **bold**, and ~~strikethrough~~ text

This text contains a [link](features/headings.md) within the documentation and a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to the outside world.

Here we show an unordered list:
- Milk
- Eggs
- Butter

And an ordered list:
1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Step 3

Docsify supports inline `code text` and code blocks:

```
fn main() {

    // Print text to the console
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
