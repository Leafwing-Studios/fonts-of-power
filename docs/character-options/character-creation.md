# Character Creation

As a player, the most important first step you need to take before starting a game of Fonts of Power is creating a character of your own. Before setting your heart on a particular character, find out more!

- As a table, discuss the **tone** and **style** of the campaign you want to run.
- Ask your worldspeaker questions about the **setting** to help ground your character in the world.
- Collaborate with the other players, and learn about the rest of your **party** as they’re forming.
- Figure out how your characters know each other, and **why everyone chooses to work together.**

Now that you have a sense of the context, find a seed for your character to grow from; an interesting idea, a piece of media or art that inspires you, or a mechanic that you want to focus on. Whenever you’re confronted with a choice, having a clear seed will help you decide which one fits who they are. If you’re struggling to find one, try answering this question: **why do you explore?**

With this seed in place, you can begin to flesh out your character, and fill out your [character sheet:](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Tl1gfyBu-I8wWSfpwi0nfqhk6kD_V6xR)

- The **species** of creatures they are part of.
  - Select any options needed for that species, such as subspecies.
- The **class** that defines how they wield magical power.
  - Select any options needed for that class, such as subclass or spells known.
- Five **skill proficiencies,** which capture their background knowledge and training.
  - You add your proficiency bonus to skill checks you are proficient with.
  * You always get to choose between a setback and an opportunity when you fail skill checks that you are proficient in.
- The unique **talents** that start to define them.
  - A skill talent.
  - A combat talent.
- The **attributes** that describe their natural aptitudes. Either:
  - They sum to +5.
  - Roll 1d6 - 1d6 five times. These are your attributes, in order. Reroll if the sum is more than +10 or less than 0.
- The **gear** that they begin the game with.
  - Create two sets of **arms,** each with an innate gear score total equal to your half your Prowess.
  - Create a set of **armor,** with an innate gear score total equal to your half your Prowess.

Next, work with your party and the worldspeaker to determine how your character fits into the world, recording:

- Their **ideals,** which describe their personal moral code. \* Assign each of the five ideals a value between 0 and 5.
- Their **backstory,** outlining their life before the game began.
- Their **appearance,** which captures what others first impressions might be.
- Their **name.**

Finally, finish your character sheet by computing your **vital statistics:**

- **Proficiency bonus:** +1 at level 1
- **Movement speed:** 6 tiles (but commonly modified by armor)
- Determine your defenses:
  - **Basic defense:** 10 + Prowess + Agility, or 10 + Agility + any relevant armor affixes
  - **Special defenses:** 10 + proficiency bonus + the corresponding attribute
- **Basic attack bonus:** proficiency bonus + Agility
- **Special attack bonus:** proficiency bonus + Expertise
- **Maximum life:** (5 + level) × 5
- **Maximum essence:** proficiency bonus × (6 + Focus)

If this is your first time creating a character in Fonts of Power, the sections below go over what these options mean, and where to find them.

More experienced groups may choose to start at a higher level, commonly level 3, to have access to a more cohesive and powerful set of options from the beginning of the campaign. This presents a harsher learning curve however, and is better suited to some narratives than others. If you do so, be sure to pick out enchanted gear as described in the Gear subsection below.

When you are creating a new character for an existing party, they begin at the same level as the party and level up in sync with the party like usual.

## Species

The character’s species determines the basic body type they have and how society perceives them at first glance. You might choose to play an adaptable Human, a mysterious Slime or an Awakened animal for instance. Select a species from the Species section of this book, or work with your worldspeaker to create a custom species and determine how they fit into the game world.

Creating new species to match your setting is incredibly easy:

1. Select two combat features. These should be balanced against combat talents or arms or armor affixes.
1. Select two adventure features. These should be balanced against skill talents or trinket affixes.
1. Optionally, split these features evenly across a base species and subspecies.
1. Add any power-neutral flavor features, such as changes to the diet, appearance, size or lifespan of your species.

## Class

The power your player character has been exposed to, or chosen to wield, shapes them in a dramatic fashion, granting them magical powers and superhuman capabilities. Each source of power is associated with a class, which describes the mechanics of using that source of power to adventure through the world and slay monsters. Select a class from the Classes section of this book, and gain the features granted at level 1.

Every class has a form of customization: a specific school of training, elements you might be affiliated with, an ideal that you hold dear or so on. This choice is also made at level 1, and is very important for determining both the combat focus and flavour of your character.

If you have a character idea that doesn’t match the mechanics described in any of the classes well, talk to your table about making changes to help you play the character you’re imagining. There are several options for this, in order of increasing effort required in order to ensure your new class is fun and balanced:

1. Reflavour the features or spells, keeping the mechanics the same, to better match your vision of what your character is doing.
1. Create new powers to select from, allowing you to take different actions within the framework of the class.
1. Create a new subclass, using the patterns established in the class, in order to change the style in which a class is played.
1. Modify features, using affixes or other class or racial features as guidelines, in order to better match the playstyle you want.
1. Create a whole new class, following the extensive guides on design and balance in the Hacker’s Guide to Fonts of Power.

## Skill Proficiencies

No one is good at everything. Decide what areas your character has focused their attention on by selecting five **skill proficiencies,** chosen freely from the list of skills.

## Talents

Characters in Fonts of Power are designed to feel unique from the very beginning. When you build a character, select:

- A **skill talent,** which lets you specialize in a particular skill.
- A **combat talent,** which starts to define your unique style of fighting.

Don’t worry if more than one talent appeals to you: every talent is also available as an affix that you can enchant onto your gear.

## Attributes

With your species, background and class decided, you should have a pretty good sense of what sort of character you’d like to play. The next thing to determine is your character’s **attributes,** which describe your natural talents.

Attributes impact your effectiveness with skills and in combat. Unlike in many other roleplaying games, every attribute is designed to affect every character in meaningful ways, no matter what class they are. If you want a high attribute for roleplaying reasons, or to be particularly good at a certain type of skill, you can typically do so safely without worrying about class. Think carefully before selecting an extremely low attribute value: it will invariably result in some serious penalties for your character both in and out of combat.

Fonts of Power uses five attributes, which are briefly summarized below:.

- **Prowess:** the ability to use more powerful weapons, armor and shields, holding creatures in a grapple, feats of strength and endurance, maintaining concentration
- **Agility:** dodging and blocking basic attacks, more accurate basic attacks, stealth, feats of dexterity, escaping grapples
- **Expertise:** hitting with spells and special attacks, beginning to grapple or shove another creature, crafting items
- **Focus:** essence to use abilities, noticing things, maintaining concentration, using magical consumables
- **Presence:** social skills, damage and absorption from spells and special attacks

Their effects are described in more detail in the _Attributes_ chapter.

Attributes can never be higher than +5 or lower than -5. There are two methods to determine their value: point buy and randomized. In point buy, the sum of your attributes must equal 5 (e.g. [+3, +2, +1, 0, -1] or [+1, +1, +1, +1, +1]). Consult the _Attributes_ chapter for the details on randomized statistics.

## Gear

Every character begins the game with two sets of arms and one set of armor, created to their exact specifications. Each of these should have a gear score total equal to your Prowess. Use the Gear chapter of this book to combine **affixes** and build arms and armor that fit your character concept.

When it comes to **adventuring gear,** characters are said to be **Prepared for Anything.** Rather than carefully budgeting your wealth and carrying capacity in order to pick out a bedroll, precisely 100 feet of rope, seven torches and a sack of flour, we assume that the party always has the basics of survival (unless there’s some reason that they wouldn’t) and typically remembered to pack or can scavenge for any specialized equipment that they might need. As described in the Prepared for Anything section of the Gear chapter, roll on the Supplies die whenever you want to find out whether the party has a particular tool or mundane item.

The table should **set the initial Supplies die** for the party to reflect their state as play begins: are they meeting in a tavern (d8), suddenly ambushed (d6), struggling to make it back to town (d4) or captured and penniless (the Supplies die is fully depleted)?

**For characters starting above level 1,** players may pick out two magical sets of arms, one set of magical armor and a collection of trinkets to begin the game with. These should each have a gear point total equal to their proficiency bonus, ensuring that they are at an appropriate power for their level. If they are level 9 or higher, this should include one prismatic affix. If they are level 17 or higher, include two prismatic affixes. We suggest experimenting with unusual choices during this initial selection, in order to make sure there’s space for interesting ways for your character to continue to grow and change.

## Ideals

Everyone has a different idea of what it means to be a good person. We use the following five ideals in our standard setting:

- **Equality:** In diversity, strength.
- **Harmony:** Peace and prosperity, hand in hand.
- **Liberty:** The courage to act; the freedom to choose.
- **Progress:** Towards a brighter tomorrow.
- **Sanctity:** I believe in doing what is right.

You can learn more about exactly what these ideals represent in the standard setting in the Ideals section of the Narrative Mechanics chapter.

Select a value between 0 and 5 for each of these ideals to reflect how much your character values them, and record them on your character sheet. If your Ideals sum to about 10, your character will be pragmatic but not heartless; playing with this total is a natural way to create amoral scoundrels or righteous crusaders.

As discussed in the Deals and Ideals section of the Scenes chapter, it will be easier to convince people to ignore moral objections when you have a low value for that ideal, and easier to convince them of the moral importance of a task when you have a high value for that ideal.

Changing the ideals to match the moral dilemmas in your own world is easy: just select a new set of moral values, being sure that characters could hold any two moral values at the same time.. We’ve found that somewhere between two and seven ideals strikes a good balance between interesting conflict and comprehensibility. Characters’ ideals interact with each other mechanically though, so be sure to change this for the table as a whole, rather than a single character.

## Backstory

Every character in the game has a past, events and connections and ideals from before the game begins to tell their story that influences their behaviour and ties them to the world. As you work out their backstory, take notes on the ideas you come up with to share with the worldspeaker and other players in the game. Feel free to leave your backstory fairly vague, and fill in the details as the story of your campaign unfolds.

Begin by working with your worldspeaker and the other players in your party to determine how everyone met, and what ties them together even in the face of danger and hardship. Several reasonable starting points are listed in the table below, with the tables beneath that expanding on those options. If you’re not sure what sort of campaign you’d like to play, the answer to this question can be a great place to start.

With the party’s purpose established, each species and class has tables that pose a number of questions that relate to the fundamental identity and dilemmas posed by your character’s species and class. These can be excellent prompts for forming a high-level picture of the type of story you want your character to have.

From there, think about what their life before adventuring was like.

- Where did they grow up?
- What was their family and community like?
- How does your character feel about them now?
- Did your character learn a trade or profession?
- What hobbies and interests do they have?
- What were the lowest and highest moments of their life so far?
- Who do they know from before the story began who might be emotionally significant, a valuable ally or an interesting rival or enemy?

Finally, think about the questions most pertinent to their life as an adventurer, tying together their past and explaining how they mesh with the party.

- How did they gain their magical powers that they develop through their class?
- **\* How** do they feel about these powers?
- What sort of moral standards do they hold themselves and others to?
- What ideals do they pursue, even when it’s inconvenient?
- What flaws do they struggle with that tend to land them in trouble?
- Why are they adventurers, rather than living a quiet life?

## Appearance

It’s often helpful for other players and the worldspeaker to have a sense of what your character looks like and how they’re perceived in social circumstances. Create two sections of text, either as a paragraph or in point form.

The first section should describe your character’s physical appearance: things like how they dress, what their body is like and how they move. The second section concerns the character’s social perception: how they talk, their gender, their preferred approach to common social scenarios, the first impression that they give off when they enter a room full of strangers.

What you describe in these sections has very little, if any, mechanical impact. A hulking brute and a lithe huntress are both equally capable of breaking open a door, so long as they have equivalent Attributes and proficiencies. Similarly, a cunning con man and a thoughtful preacher are both equally capable of persuading a monster to stop its rampage. The descriptions here are useful to guide you and the worldspeaker to describe the approach used and the outcomes obtained when you make skill checks or perform feats in combat. The brute might smash down the door with his bare fists, while the huntress may find a make-shift pry bar in the area around them. The conman may convince the monster that its interests really aren’t served by eating the villagers, while the preacher may appeal to its inner morality.

## Name

Your character’s name can be as serious, silly, meaningful or arbitrary as you like. To get you started, you can lean on a few conventions from the standard setting:

- **Automaton:** Automaton typically begin their existence with only a series of numbers and letters identifying your model and build number. As they gain sentience, they are later repurposed into something more personal. Ex: 0x5F3759DF > “Square”, 0xA981178D > Abiit.
- **Awakened:** The Awakened see names as a point of pride; something to be earned. Their names record their exploits and accomplishments, growing in length as they do great things. Ex.
- **Crystalline:** Named after types of minerals or geologic features, Crystalline carefully reflect on their choice of names, selecting a name to honor unusual beauty. Ex: Amethyst, Dolomite, Karst.
- **Fae:** Drawing inspiration from the nature that surrounds them, fae are named when they come of age according to a natural feature whose character they share. Ex.
- **Human:** Humans have simple names, largely devoid of personal significance. Their first names are a unique identifier,, while their last name is shared amongst their family members. Ex.
- **Reclaimer:** Elaborate and fanciful, reclaimers tend to borrow and improve upon the naming conventions of the other cultures that they live with, creating a strange patchwork of names. Ex.
- **Slime:** Whimsical and light-hearted, slimes choose their names based on their preferred object (or creature) to mimic. Ex. Gilded Treasure Chest, Cavalry, Ominous Crystal.
- **Sylvan:** Refined and traditional, a Sylvan’s first name describes their family’s heritage, while their second name describes a distinguishing trait that others can use to identify them. Ex.
- **Undead:** Undead typically keep the names they had in their previous life, one last symbolic tie to their past. Those who have forgotten their past, or seek to reject it typically adopt a new name from the culture that has taken them in.
