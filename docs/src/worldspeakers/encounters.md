See [Monster Motivations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KV15USBZ8DOAUen25lFb1FthHYcGYEkDrIpvTvHP8Yw/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet for goals from monsters.

Also consider current narrative arc, quests and goals players have.

## Arena design

1. Design a tactical goal.
   1. Capture or hold a position.
   2. Escape.
   3. Ambush.
   4. Use an interactable to turn the tides of the fight.
2. Design basic outline of arena.
   1. Draw boundaries.
   2. Add the zones of interest required for the goal.
   3. Designate starting zones for each side.
      1. Each should be about 4 - 10 tiles in size.
3. Add interest.
   1. Cover.
   2. Difficult terrain.
   3. Vantages.
   4. Verticality.
   5. Hidden creatures.
   6. Connectivity.
   7. Triggered events that change the fight over time.

## Monster Building

1. Select a total number of turns: should be within 1 of the players.
   1. Divide these turns across the monsters in the combat.
2. Set life totals: 25 * turns per round.
3. Set proficiency bonus to within 1 of the players.
4. Set attributes: total should be 5 + 2 * proficiency bonus.
   1. Total pool is increased
5. Build or choose base arms and armor.
   1. One set of arms, one set of armor.
6. Choose affixes such that enchantment point total is equal to 2 * proficiency bonus.
   1. These can be discovered by the players if they win!
   2. Consider drawing from font's pool of affixes.
   3. Some affixes are monster-only: they don't make sense or are broken on players and are excluded from the pool players can gain.
7. Build or choose 3 powers. Can replace one power for an extra set of arms.
   1. Same balance as player powers: 1 essence = 1 AP.
   2. Try to avoid spending more than 3 essence per turn on average to limit burst.
