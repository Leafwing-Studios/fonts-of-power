Each font needs:

- one **quirk**, which alters the rules of exploration
- 10 Anima vantages and 10 Fontcraft vantages
- 10 Fontcraft vantages, which use strange magical effects or unusual terrain to create tactical interest
  - these are used to add tactical interest to your arenas
  - these can be added to existing arenas by players with the Shape downtime activity
  - Anima vantages use wild plants, animals and other life-forms, while Fontcraft uses strange magical effects or unusual terrain
- 40 arms affixes and 40 armor affixes
  - 10 of each of these should be particularly flavorful, and designed to match the font's character
  - these are used for ingredients in the Harvest downtime activity, and are good seeds to inspire the monsters that you create.
