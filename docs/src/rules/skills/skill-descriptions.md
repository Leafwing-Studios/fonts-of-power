# Skill Descriptions

## Anima

Anima is the study of plants, animals and monsters: their habits, biology and uses.
Use Anima if you want to track a monster, determine what the mysterious scratches on the cave wall are, or guess what eating this strange plant might do.

Anima is typically performed using Focus, when tracking creatures, or Expertise, when attempting to recall information on their habits or enchanting items.

## Athletics

Athletics represents your ability to perform great feats of athletic skill, strength and dexterity.
If you need to break down a door, lift a boulder, swim across a lake, scale a cliff, swing from a chandelier, leap across a chasm or so on, this is the skill to use.

Athletics checks almost always use either Prowess or Agility.
Prowess is for typical feats of skill and strength, while Agility is used for particularly delicate maneuvers, where a misstep could result in consequences.

## Charm

Charm is used to openly and directly influence people by whatever means necessary.
You may be trying to convince them of a fact, scare them away or get them to like you.
You might choose to do so by persuading them, deceiving them, intimidating them or wowing them with a magic trick, work of art or piece of music.

Charm skill checks are, by default, made using Presence, as they rely on your strength of personality and understanding of other people.
However, if you are attempting to influence people in a way that relies on your ability to perform a particular feat, you should use an appropriate ability score for that feat instead, such as:

* Agility for playing an instrument
* Prowess for scaring them away by pounding on the table
* Expertise for weaving a convincing illusion

## Endurance

Endurance is the talent for pushing through when things get difficult, attempting to endure pain or fatigue or distraction in order to accomplish your goal.

Endurance skill checks are almost always made using either Prowess or Focus. Prowess (Endurance) checks are made to ignore physical stimulus, while Focus (Endurance) checks are made to hold your focus for an extended period of time in the face of distractions, or manipulate essence in an exhausting fashion.

## Fontcraft

Fontcraft is used to understand the world around you: the natural environment, fonts of power, and the bushcraft skills needed to survive.
If you want to look for herbs, read a map, or investigate a font of power, this is the skill to use.

A common use of Fontcraft is to attempt to understand your surroundings. When you do so, your worldspeaker can use the table below as a guide to what information you might gain with various results.

| Expertise (Fontcraft) check result | Information Gained                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5                                  | What is the current danger level of our location?                      |
| 10                                 | Where are we, relative to other points of interest that we know about? |
| 15                                 | What sort of hazards should the party be wary of?                      |
| 20                                 | What other creatures use this environment?                             |
| 25                                 | How can we use the environment to our advantage?                       |

Fontcraft typically uses Focus, when carefully studying your surroundings or navigating, or Expertise, when enchanting magical items or recalling facts about a particular type of terrain or font of power.

## Guidance

Guidance is about leadership by example, focusing on emotions and practical support, rather than swaying others with argument.
It is used to sway people on moral questions, lead a group, display empathy and train both people and animals.
You might try to strengthen or dismiss moral convictions on a pressing question, rally your allies as you demoralize your foes, or effectively coordinate and manage an entire movement.

Guidance typically uses Presence, as it is focused on understanding and interacting with other people.
If your leadership is by example, you might use the attribute associated with that display of skill instead, such as using Expertise (Guidance) for teaching a class of tradesfolk.

## Humanities

Humanities is used to test your recollection and field skills in the study of sentient species: their anthropology, sociology, psychology, history, politics and so on.

Humanities checks are typically made using either Presence or Expertise.
When you are attempting to understand the dynamics of a group, or try to understand someone’s motivations, a Presence (Humanities) check is used.
Recalling information about the history, politics or anthropology of a culture on the other hand would require an Expertise (Humanities) check.

## Insight

Insight is used to piece together information, solve puzzles, figure out what drives people you meet, or to figure out carefully search for subtle objects.

The Insight skill does not automatically allow you to determine whether an NPC is lying.
Instead, use the Clue system described in the Narrative Mechanics chapter.

Carefully searching a room, typically takes about 10 minutes. The worldspeaker makes a secret Focus (Insight) skill check on your behalf to determine what you find.

Insight typically calls for Focus, as it requires you to focus and gather your thoughts about a situation.
However, social deduction is handled using Presence and clues to literal puzzles use Expertise.

## Medicine

Medicine is used to treat the wounded, diagnose illnesses and cure the sick.

When a creature is unconscious due to being below 0 life, you may attempt to stabilize its ailment by spending 10 minutes and making an Expertise (Medicine) skill check. They regain life equal to your result although do not exceed zero life.
Once a creature has been tended to in this way, they cannot be stabilized again until after they heal above 0 life through other means.

Medicine can use a wide range of attributes, depending on the task at hand.
Carefully transporting an ally with a spinal injury would require Prowess, stitching a wound would require Agility, recalling information about a disease would require Expertise, making a diagnosis from the facts at hand would require Focus, and comforting the ill would require Presence.

## Perception

Perception is the talent for noticing unusual things in your surroundings, identifying a strange shape on the horizon and hearing a suspicious rustle of leaves. If the task involves the acuity of your senses or your level of alertness, this is the skill to use.

Perception is virtually exclusively used with Focus, as it requires careful attention and awareness.

## Stealth

Stealth is used to hide, move silently and otherwise go unnoticed.

If you’re in Combat, see the Hide action for fair and fast rules.
If you need to set a difficulty for a specific action, you can use the guidelines below.
For a system to handle extended stealth gameplay in a fair and interesting way, see Scenes > Trickery Scenes.

**Stealth skill check difficulty guidelines**

| Difficulty | Movement Type                                           | Example Activity             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 5          | Crawling or moving at half your movement speed per turn | Picking an item off a shelf  |
| 10         | Walking (moving at your movement speed per turn)        | Opening a door               |
| 15         | Dashing (using the Dash action once per turn)           | Rummaging through a chest    |
| 20         | Sprinting (using the Dash action twice per turn)        | Engaging in a turn of combat |
| 25         | Scrambling down a loose stone slope                     | Ringing a bell               |

Stealth is almost always a matter of Agility, as it requires careful, thoughtful movement.
If you are attempting to blend into a crowd, a Presence (Stealth) check may be called for instead.

## Tinkering

Tinkering is used to understand, mess with and build mechanical devices.

Tinkering is typically either performed using Agility, such as when you are opening locks or disabling traps, or Expertise, when you are crafting an item or examining a complex mechanism.

## Trickery

Trickery is used to perform various acts of subtle skill and skulduggery: stealing items, picking locks, creating disguises, forging documents, tying ropes and so on.
If it seems like the clever or devious act of a roguish scoundrel and isn’t covered by any other skills, use Trickery as the skill of choice.

You may attempt to steal, plant or hide on your person an item that you can hold in one hand by making an Agility (Trickery) skill check opposed by the other party's Focus (Perception) passive skill check.
You have disadvantage on this check if the object is larger than an apple, or if the item is closely guarded.

For a system to handle elaborate schemes in a fair and interesting way, see Scenes > Trickery Scenes.

Stealing (or planting) items uses Agility, while forging documents and creating disguises calls for Expertise.
