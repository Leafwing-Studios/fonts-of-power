# Skills

**Skills** are the mundane (or perhaps slightly more than that) talents that your character uses to interact with the world.
Whenever a character tries to do something challenging, and there is an interesting **narrative fork** created depending on whether they succeed or fail, make a skill check.
If success or failure is guaranteed, or when either success or failure would lead to a serious slowdown in play with no clear path forward, or break immersion in the game world, don’t bother making a skill check.
Instead, just narrate what happens.

Different activities require different types of knowledge and talent, broken down for the sake of this game into the discrete skills found below.
Your ability with these skills is a combination of innate talent and learned expertise; represented in gameplay terms by your attributes (such as Agility or Focus) and whether or not you are proficient in a particular skill such as Stealth or Medicine.

Once you have made a skill check to complete a task in a particular fashion, you cannot do so again unless the circumstances have materially changed.

There are 15 skills in _Fonts of Power_, briefly described below. At level 1, each character gains proficiency in 5 skills of their choice, and may gain proficiency in an extra skill or two as a result of their selection of species or class.
