# Making Skill Checks

To make a skill check, first nail down precisely what you’re trying to do, in narrative terms. Are you trying to open that locked door by bashing it in or picking the lock? Are you convincing the innkeeper to give you a free drink by telling him a lie about how you’re an orphan who drowns their sorrow in ale, or by flexing your muscles menacingly at him?

Once that’s done, as a table, you need to figure out how hard the task is, setting a **difficulty.** The table below gives some general guidelines, with difficulties ranging from about 5 to 25, increasing as the task gets harder. Impossible or nonsensical tasks, such as trying to persuade a door to unlock itself, jumping 100 meters in the air without any special ability to do so or crafting a magical item without enough materials simply aren’t possible, no matter what the result of your skill check might be.

**When should you use a skill check?**

In general, skill checks should only be called for if **both success and failure are interesting outcomes.** For example, suppose the party is trying to climb a ledge that is 20 feet high. It is tempting to use a Prowess (Athletics) skill check here, but this would waste time for little benefit. The ledge is not high enough to pose any serious consequences for falling, and there are no other interesting paths forward. However, this need not be the case. If the party is being hunted, then it would be fitting to use an [Attrition Scene](rules/scenes/attrition-scenes) to punish extra time taken. If there were an alternate path with a different form of risk, the failure to climb the ledge pushes the story in a new and interesting direction, so the check should be used. A higher ledge _might_ be enough to warrant a check, since falling could cause damage, but if the party has ample time to rest, the damage would still be inconsequential.

In general, setting the difficulty of skill checks should be done as a table based on these guidelines, but sometimes, there are things you don’t know about the difficulty of the task: a door may be a dummy, the innkeeper may not be who he appears or a disease may be much rarer and more deadly than you expected. In that case, the worldspeaker has leeway to decide the outcomes of any skill check that you make based on the actual facts of the world that are unknown to you.

**Guidelines for Difficulty**

| Difficulty | Description                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5          | Trivial and mundane. Should not pose an issue to any but the most impaired. |
| 10         | A routine task. Reliably completed by those with training.                  |
| 15         | A challenging task, even for experts.                                       |
| 20         | A very hard task.                                                           |
| 25         | Nearly impossible, only accessible to true masters.                         |

With a difficulty set, the player finalizes their decision to act and rolls to see how their attempts compare to the difficulty of the task. Your success at a task is determined by three elements: random chance due to factors outside of your control, innate talent and trained skill. By adding together all three (1d20 + Attribute + proficiency bonus if you are proficient in that skill) and comparing your **result** to the difficulty of the task, you can find out how you performed on the uncertain task.

Random chance is incorporated by rolling a d20: this can represent everything from the quality of your execution to previously undeclared details about the setting. An innkeeper might be in a particularly surly mood due to a bad customer earlier or he might have just received a huge tip; a door might be jammed shut or freshly oiled or even barricaded from the other side. As a worldspeaker, the rolls of your players on skill checks can be a great opportunity to add mundane detail and interesting depth to your world on the fly.

Next up is to determine how raw talent comes into play. For this, you must select one of the five attributes to use for the skill check. Prowess is used for feats of strength and physical endurance. Agility is for careful movement and manual skill. Expertise is for learned knowledge and tasks of memory. Focus is used for mental endurance and attention to detail. And finally, Presence is for personal conviction and social skills.

The next step is to determine which skill comes into play. Skills reflect learned knowledge and expertise, and the skill descriptions [on the next page](rules/skills/skill-descriptions.md) describe the domains covered by each skill. If you are proficient in a skill, add your proficiency bonus to the results of your skill check. As a result, solving problems in a fashion that reflects your character’s strength (and stepping back to let your party members take over when you’re out of depth) is critical to success.

All skill checks have an associated attribute and skill. If you’re not sure which choice is most fitting, allow the acting player to choose from the plausible options.

Specific tasks laid out in the rules often ask for skill checks in the form of, for example, a difficulty 15 Agility (Stealth) check. This is a convenient shorthand, which means that the task’s difficulty is 15, the relevant attribute is Agility and the relevant skill is Stealth.

Once the result of a skill check (including those made by NPCs) has been determined, the party may spend one Resolve to change the die rolled to either a 5 or 15. If they do, recalculate the results, including any immediate narrative consequences.

## Degrees of Success

In _Fonts of Power,_ skill checks made outside of combat do not result in binary success or failure. No matter the difficulty of the task, a higher skill check result means a better outcome.

The details of what this means depends on the fiction of the scene. While the worldspeaker determines the details of the world based on the skill check result, the players determine how they respond to the circumstance presented to them, in a way that is consistent with their degree of success.

Failing a skill check is handled in one of three ways:

- If you are not proficient in a skill check and fail it by 5 or more, you suffer an **outright failure.**
- Otherwise, you may choose between:
  _ Essentially succeeding on a skill check but suffering a **setback.**
  _ Failing on a skill check, but gaining an **opportunity.**

Outright failure should have consequences. If you cannot think of any meaningful consequences to failure, a skill check is likely inappropriate. An outright failure might look like:

- You fail to leap across a chasm, and fall into a pit swarming with snakes.
- You fail to convince your rival to put aside your differences, and they focus their attacks on you rather than the monster.
- You fail to discover the information you’re looking for, and must venture into the font of power totally unprepared.

Setbacks are a cost incurred due to pushing through to succeed in the face of serious adversity. You might:

- You succeed at enchanting a magical item, but it comes with a strange drawback as well.
- You force the door open, but gain a stack of exhaustion for overexerting yourself.
- You succeed at navigating the ruins, but it took so long that your supplies are running low. Reduce your Supplies die once.
- You succeed at convincing someone to help you, but aggravate the rival faction in the process, causing their loyalty towards you to decrease by 1.
- You succeed at disarming an arcane trap but do so clumsily, drawing unwanted attention.
- You succeed at convincing your mark to tell you where his treasure is hidden, but have roused his suspicion, giving you disadvantage on skill checks made to steal it.

<div class="infobox">

**Setbacks and Knowledge**

If a player chooses a setback when attempting to recall or gain information, the worldspeaker should roll 1d10 in secret. If the result is greater than or equal to the difference between the skill check result and the required difficulty, the player recalls or learns the information successfully. Otherwise, they misremember, misinterpret a fact or were simply lied to and should be told incorrect information. If they choose an opportunity, they should remember something different but related and helpful.

</div>

When a skill check’s outcome is based on the final result, rather than a specific threshold (such as the Devise downtime activity or the use of Anima to learn about monsters you encounter), success at a cost means that you succeed at the tier higher than your rolled, but take a setback in exchange.

Opportunities represent the opening of other metaphorical doors, made possible by cutting your losses early when presented with an overly difficult task. Opportunities keep play moving, but in different ways. Some ways this might happen include:

- You fail to find the solution to the puzzle, but realize something about the lock holding it in place, giving you advantage on your skill check made to pick it.
- You fail to turn up any leads about your suspect, but hear another interesting rumor as you canvas the city’s bars.
- You fail to discover anything about the monster you’re hunting, but learn something important about its environment instead.
- You fail to sway the bullies from their course of action, but a stranger oversees your kindness and will remember it.

It often makes sense to delay the opportunity gained for a scene or two, rather than forcing it into the narrative immediately.

When you succeed on a skill check, there are two possible outcomes:

- A **simple success.**
- A **smashing success,** in which you beat the difficulty by 5 or more.

Simple successes are straightforward and let the story move on without complication. By contrast, smashing successes should reflect a stroke of good luck or exceptional skill at the task, taking the story in a slightly different direction. This might mean:

- You succeed at calming down the panicked NPC, and they volunteer some helpful information.
- You succeed at carefully navigating through the hazardous thorns, and are able to show your allies the way, granting them advantage on their own skill checks.
- You succeed at finding the hidden ruins, and discover a secret entrance while you’re at it.
- You succeed at treating the stranger’s wounds, and gain advantage on the skill check made to convince them to retreat to safety.
- You succeed at tracking down the beast you are pursuing, and stumble upon a rich magical grove. Gain the benefits of the Harvest downtime activity.

**Success and failure on skill checks made as part of combat is binary.** This helps keep simple skill checks with well-defined mechanics (such as the Treat or Hide minor actions) fast and fair.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, the circumstances or special abilities make performing tasks easier or harder: you may have all the time in the world or be under tight pressure, the weather might have made the rocks you’re trying to climb slippery, you might have grown up right near that ancient shrine or your character may be particularly adept at solving criminal mysteries. If the table agrees that a circumstance changes the difficulty of a task meaningfully, grant advantage or disadvantage to the skill check.

If you are making a skill check with **advantage,** roll two d20s and select the higher one. If you are making a skill check with **disadvantage,** roll two d20s and select the lower one.

Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out on a one-to-one basis in Fonts of Power. If you have sources of both advantage and disadvantage, compare the number of sources:

- If the number of sources of advantage is greater than the number of sources of disadvantage, you have advantage on the roll
- If it is lower you have disadvantage
- If they are equal you have neither advantage nor disadvantage on the roll and roll one d20 like usual

## Opposed Skill Checks

Sometimes, you may be acting directly against another creature in some way, either directly competing on the same task or working against each other in an asymmetric fashion. When this happens, an **opposed skill check** is called for. You may be arm-wrestling a monster, being chased through the streets, competing to discover an invention first or trying to steal an item from underneath a watchful eye.

Set up a skill check for each creature like normal, except that no difficulty is set. Then, roll skill check results for each creature. Whoever has the highest result succeeds, with ties going to the creature that initiated the action, or the player if neither or both did.

When one party has a clearly easier job than the other, a flat bonus should be applied to their skill check based on the difference in difficulty tier following the Guidelines for Difficulty table at the start of this chapter, determined before any dice are rolled.

## Group Skill Checks

Fairly often, more than one character will attempt to perform a single skill-based task at the same time. You may be trying to force open a door, recall information or talk down an angry monster. There are a few ways to adjudicate these situations, designed to balance realism, fast game play and reward roleplay that matches mechanical strengths.

Use these questions to determine which rules mechanism is most appropriate for your situation:

1. Does the task involve more than one person?
   - Yes: Proceed to 2.
   - No: Only the character performing the task rolls.
1. Is the task easier to perform with more than one person?
   - Yes: Proceed to 3.
   - No: Every character rolls separately, succeeding or failing on their own.
1. Is everyone performing the same sort of activity?
   - Yes: Are two or more people proficient in the skill used for the task?
     - Yes: The character with the highest single modifier rolls with advantage.
     - No: The character with the highest single modifier rolls normally.
   - No: Proceed to 4.
1. Design a secondary skill challenge for the players who are helping enable the main task. Did the secondary skill challenge succeed?
   - Yes: The character performing the main task rolls with advantage.
   - No: The character performing the main task rolls normally.

## Secret Checks

## Secret Skill Checks

When forces conspire against the party, the worldspeaker rolls skill checks for those NPCs in secret to determine the outcome of their efforts.

Whenever an NPC makes a risky or challenging action, make a skill check. In the case of direct opposition, set the difficulty of the required skill check as 10 + the highest relevant modifier. Otherwise, use the Guidelines for Difficulty table above. Even if the NPC succeeds on a skill

When the results of an NPC (or trap) are revealed, make a retroactive skill check to determine if the party noticed the actions just in time, giving them the ability to immediately respond.

If the party grows suspicious, they may make a **paranoid** skill check. This is an opposed skill check, with the party rolling openly while the worldspeaker rolling in secret (regardless of whether or not an adversary actually exists), then the worldspeaker describes the immediate outcome.
The party may spend Resolve as usual to modify the opponent's roll after the outcome is described, but are not able to see the roll made before doing so.
Analgous to the rules that you cannot repeat a skill check indefinitely, the party cannot make a paranoid skill check again until after their next rest.

When players are hiding from or deceiving NPCs, use a [_Trickery Scene_](../scenes/trickery-scenes.md) instead, setting the difficulties in the same fashion and tracking the gradually-rising suspicion of the NPCs.
