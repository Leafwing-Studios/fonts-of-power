# Attributes

Attributes define the basic statistics of your character: how naturally talented they are in the various facets of daily life. No one is good at everything and your strengths (and weaknesses) always have a chance to shine, no matter what class you’re playing.

Fonts of Power uses five attributes: **Prowess, Agility, Expertise, Focus** and **Presence.** Each attribute ranges from -5 to +5. You cannot exceed these limits by any means.

## Prowess

Prowess represents your physical strength, hardiness and athletic talent. A character with a high Prowess may be a strapping blacksmith, a tough and wiry athlete or a talented young swordswoman. A character with a low Prowess may be a scholar who can barely hold their books, a chronically ill urchin or a retired adventurer who can no longer wear the heavy plate armor that he used to.

When making skill checks, Prowess would be used when a door needs to be forced open, a tough climb made or bitter cold endured.

Attacks against your Prowess defense include being grabbed by a monstrous tentacle and being poisoned.

In combat, your Prowess is added to your basic defense, reflecting your ability to wear heavier armor, and the damage you deal with any [basic attack](combat/acting-in-combat/major-actions.md?id=strike), whether that's the damage from a crushing mace or the strength of your bow. It is also used to [Block](combat/acting-in-combat/reactions.md?id=block) attacks effectively, as well as maintain and escape from [grapples](combat/acting-in-combat/major-actions.md?id=grapple).

## Agility

Agility represents your nimbleness, manual dexterity and ability to strike accurately. A character with a high Agility may be a virtuoso magician, a stealthy scout or an expert watchmaker who can carefully disassemble intricate mechanisms. A character with a low Agility may be a clumsy princess who keeps tripping over her dress, an old man whose hands can’t stop shaking or a young knight who just can’t get the movements right no matter how hard they try.

When making skill checks, Agility would be used when you need to sneak past a guard, lift a purse, or disable a trap.

Attacks against your Agility defense include a trap suddenly dropping the floor out from underneath you and a mage launching blasts of magical energy that go whizzing by your head.

In combat, Agility is used to determine your ability to dodge and strike accurately. Your basic attack modifier, used to determine your chance to hit with a sword swing or a launched arrow, is given by your proficiency bonus plus your Agility. Your Agility is also added to your basic defense, making you harder to hit, and also improves your [Dodge](combat/acting-in-combat/reactions.md?id=dodge). When you use the [Hide](combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions.md?id=hide) minor action, you make an Agility (Stealth) skill check to obfuscate your position.

## Expertise

Expertise represents talent at mastering technical skills both in combat and out of it, ability to understand complex systems and the precision with which you can channel essence into powerful effects. A character with a high Expertise may be a scholar full of knowledge, a talented artist, or an old master of the blade who, although he may not be as strong or fast as he once was, is still renowned for his technique. A character with a low Expertise may be a warrior who prefers charging in head first over all these fancy techniques, a young man struggling to learn his trade or a kind-hearted priest who often forgets the details of the scripture but fills in with words to the same effect.

When making skill checks, Expertise would be used when you need to do research, recall a piece of information about something you encounter, or design a magical item.

Attacks against your Expertise defense include an illusion of a monster charging at you and an elaborate magical technique which makes you ethereal.

In combat, Expertise determines the reliability of your powers. Your special attack bonus is given by your proficiency bonus plus your Expertise, and is used for launching fireballs at your enemies, paralyzing them in fear landing a grapple or tripping them. The [Scan](combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions.md?id=scan) minor action also relies on Expertise for recalling facts about the enemies and areas that you are facing.

## Focus

Focus represents your internal determination, your ability to focus, and your ability to manipulate essence. A character with a high Focus may be a keen-eyed guard, a dogged detective or a magic user with the ability to hold their concentration even as a tremendous amount of magical energy flows through them. A character with a low Focus may be an absent-minded professor, a novice overwhelmed by their own magic, or a half-blind crone.

When making skill checks, Focus would be used to spot a hidden monster, activate a dangerous magical object safely, resurrect fallen allies, or piece together a mystery.

Attacks against your Focus defense include being overloaded with magical energy that flows through you or your soul being slowly drained from you.

In combat, your Focus determines the amount of essence you have, which is consumed whenever you use a powerful ability. You can regain essence using the Essence Tap minor action, whose effectiveness also depends on Focus. The [Scan](combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions.md?id=scan) minor action often relies on Focus for determining details about the state of combat, and the [Track](combat/acting-in-combat/reactions.md?id=track) reaction uses Focus (Perception) to stop creatures from hiding from you.

## Presence

Presence represents your personal Charm, the force of your convictions and the intensity of your internal flame. A character with a high Presence may be a charming traveller, a tyrant who rules with an iron first or a gruff old squad captain who knows how to inspire his troops. A character with a low Presence may be a sycophantic coward, a sucker always looking for easy money or a young woman still doubting her convictions and identity.

When making skill checks, Presence would be used to manipulate or understand social circumstances, whether that is by persuasive argument, subtle threats or blatant lies.

Attacks against your Presence defense include a monster roaring trying to scare you away and a spell which convinces you that your allies are plotting to betray you.

In combat, Presence describes the force backing up your essence as it transforms into tangible effect. Virtually all powers add your Presence to the damage they deal or the absorption that they grant.

## Determining Attributes {docsify-ignore}

There are two standard options for assigning Attributes to a new character: array, point buy and randomized. In general, feel free to pick the one you like best on a per character basis as the typical outcomes are roughly equivalent.

No matter your choice, remember that you can always redistribute attribute points slowly over time as you level up.

### Point Buy

In the point buy method, choose any combination of attributes that sum to 5.
Like always, attributes cannot go below -5 or above +5.

This method is best suited for players who want to have complete control over their characters to match a specific concept.

Using [+3, +2, +1, 0, -1] as your array of attributes (in any order) follows these rules, and gives a specialized but still well-rounded character. If you’re not sure what to pick, use this array.

### Randomized

In the randomized method:
Determine each attribute randomly as 1d6 - 1d6 + 1. These are rolled in order.
If the total of your attributes is above 10 or below 0, reroll your stats.
If any of your attributes is above +5, redistribute the point to an attribute of your choice.

This method is suitable for players who are looking to roleplay characters who stumbled onto their power, are looking for unique mechanical hooks and challenges or who simply enjoy leaving their fate to the dice.
