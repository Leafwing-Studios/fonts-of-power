# Combat

Combat forms an important part of Fonts of Power, and has a set of rules to ensure that fighting monsters is an interesting, smooth, and fair experience for everyone involved. There are two critical concepts that drive combat in this game.

The first is time: rather than the nebulous **narrative time** that is used during roleplay, where things take as long as the table decides, fights run on **combat time,** a strictly regimented clock where every creature involved in combat takes their turn in order before the sequence restarts.

The smallest unit of combat time is a **turn,** in which a creature gets to act. A **round** refers to one complete loop through the turn order. Each round lasts about 5 seconds, and all actions in a round occur, from the perspective of the narrative, simultaneously. The idea of distinct turns is a convenient fiction to make the game feasible to play.

The second core concept is **positioning.** In order to make combat clearer and more interesting, each creature has an exact position at all times, occupying one or more tiles, Each **tile** can only hold one creature at a time, and you cannot pass through a tile that holds another creature unless they are your ally or prone.

**Variant: Zone-based combat

Rather than carefully defining a grid-based map, feel you can use zones.

TODO: explain how to use zones.

We recommend playing using a **hexagonal** or **square grid map** for combat, in order to be able to keep track of where each creature is and measure ranges quickly.
