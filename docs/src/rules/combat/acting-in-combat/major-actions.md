# Major Actions

## Defend

Attacks against you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

## Grapple

Make a melee special attack against Prowess against another creature within a one tile range. If you hit, they gain the [grappled](../../conditions/statuses.md?id=grappled) status, and you gain the [grappling](../../conditions/statuses.md?id=grappling) status.

You have disadvantage on Grapple attacks made against creatures smaller than a quarter of your size (in tiles). You cannot make Grapple attacks against creatures that are more than four times your size. You cannot make Grapple attacks while you have the grappled or grappling status.

**Getting a grip on grappling**

Grappling can be a nuisance to get your head around, so here's an overview.

Let's suppose that our hero Alex has grappled by Lami, a terrible serpentine monster that's very fond of hugs.

Held fast, Alex can't spend movement. This means he can't run away, but he also can't stand up from prone or start flying.

Grappling is a rather involved process, so both parties have disadvantage on basic attacks against other creatures, neither can dodge, and neither can grapple anyone else. Because both of them are in an enemy zone of control, they also have disadvantage on any ranged attacks.

If Lami wants to drag Alex around, they can spend some of their movement to move Alex instead. They must remain adjacent to Alex at all times, or the grapple immediately breaks. In this way, they can drag Alex across the battlefield by spending twice as much movement as normal.

If forced movement, such as a blast of air from one of Alex's allies, was to move either of them, it is divided between them evenly, rounding down first. They stay together, and

If Alex isn't terribly fond of getting grabbed, he can:

- Have a high Prowess so the initial special attack against Prowess is hard to hit.
- Use the Dodge reaction to use his Agility (Athletics) slip out of the initial grapple.
- Use the Break Grapple minor action to use his Prowess (Athletics) to break free.
- Have an ally use the Break Grapple minor action to break him out instead.
- Use the Reverse Grapple major action to break free and then grapple Lami himself!

## Reverse Grapple

Gain the benefits of the Break Grapple minor action to free yourself from a grapple. If you succeed, you may shift once, then immediately make a Grapple attack against the creature that was grappling you.

## Strike

Strike at your target with your currently equipped set of arms. Make a basic attack against a creature or object within range of your current arms.

By default, the damage dealt by basic attacks is 1d8 + Prowess.

This damage, as well as any other special effects that might be applied by your basic attacks, is determined by the affixes of the arms used. See the _Gear_ chapter for full details.
