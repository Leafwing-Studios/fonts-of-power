# Movement

At the start of each round, each creature gains **movement** to spend equal to their **movement speed.** By default, creatures have a movement speed of 6 tiles.

During your turn(s), you may spend this movement to travel across the battlefield. Unsurprisingly, you can spend 1 tile of movement to **travel** 1 tile. You may spend this movement at any point during your turn, and break it up as you please. For example, you could move out from behind cover, fire an arrow at your enemy using the Strike major action, and then spend the remainder of your movement to retreat safely.

Some forms of movement that you might be more (or less) difficult than usual. While on **difficult terrain,** it costs twice as much movement to travel. The same is true for attempting to move while prone, or by swimming or climbing. If you have multiple modifiers to your movement speed (for example if you were affected by the chilled ailment while crossing difficult terrain), they stack multiplicatively.

**You may not pass through tiles occupied by enemy creatures** unless they are prone. **You may not end your movement in a tile occupied by another creature** unless they or you take up zero tiles.

You may spend movement equal to half of your movement speed to **stand up from prone** (or travel between height tiers or take flight if you can fly). As you are not travelling, this is not doubled if you are affected by the chilled or withered ailments, or difficult terrain. Spending movement in these fashions (or for similar actions) always cost at least 1 tile of movement, even if half of the creature's movement speed would be less than that.

**So how big is a tile?**

_Fonts of Power_, as a system, isn't intended for simulating precise imaginary realities. That said, it's often handy to have a sense of how big something might be, in order to imagine it more clearly or estimate feasibility of activities outside of combat. Tiles (and height tiers) in fonts of power are, by default, about 1 meter in size.
