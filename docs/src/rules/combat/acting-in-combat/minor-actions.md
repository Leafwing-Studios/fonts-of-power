# Minor Actions

## Activate

Use a consumable, or temporarily attune to a magical item.

Choose one:

- Gain the benefits of a consumable magic item whose gear point total is less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. These are created using the Devise downtime activity.
- Consume an essence crystals directly to restore 5 times your proficiency bonus essence.
- Temporarily attune (or unattune) to a magical item until the end of your next rest, ignoring your attunement limit. Like usual, the enchantment gear point total of these items must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus.

Using this action repeatedly risks **essence overload** as your body struggles to handle the intense magical energy. If you have used this action since you last completed a rest, make a Focus (Arcana) skill check. Gain 5 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

**Priming consumables**

Some consumables must be **primed** before they are **activated,** such as consumables with the _tripwire_ modifier. In this case, the modifier will specify how the consumable is primed, and what activates it.

In this case, the consumable’s effects (and the risk of essence overload) only occur when the activation criteria is met. Consumables may be **unprimed** by using the Activate minor action a second time before they activate.

## Break Grapple

Attempt to break another creature’s hold on a target, ending the grappled status on yourself or another creature within 1 tile of you.

To do so, make an opposed Prowess (Athletics) skill check against the grappling creature. If you succeed, the grapple ends.

## Dash

Gain movement equal to half your movement speed.

## Essence Tap

Regain essence equal to three times your proficiency bonus and make a Focus (Endurance) skill check. Gain 3 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

When you attempt to spend more essence than you currently have, you automatically and immediately gain the benefits of the Essence Tap minor action, but only restore essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

When monsters Essence Tap, they gain 6 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by their skill check result in the usual fashion.

## Guard

Attacks against you by a creature of your choice have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.

## Hide

Slip away from the fray for a moment, hiding on one of several possible places. When you hide, make an Agility (Stealth) skill check, and immediately loose all your remaining movement. Choose a number of valid hiding spots equal to your skill check result divided by 5, **rounded up.** Then, gain the [hidden](rules/conditions/statuses?id=hidden) status, although you do not immediately choose which hiding spot you are actually hiding in. In order for a hiding spot to be valid, it must be both **reasonable** and **veiled**:

- **Reasonable**
  - The spot is within range of your available movement when you take the Hide minor action
  - The spot is in a place that you could end your turn normally
  - The spot is large enough to contain all of your tiles
  - Reaching the spot would not trigger an tile effect or attack of opportunity
- **Veiled**
  1. At least one of the following is true:
     1. the spot is in darkness
     2. the spot is heavily shrouded
     3. the spot behind full cover, relative to all enemy creatures
  2. Or, at least two of the following are true:
     1. the spot is in dim light
     2. the spot is lightly shrouded
     3. the spot is behind partial (or full) cover, relative to all enemy creatures

After you have selected your hiding spots, choose one that you are hidden in and secretly record it. You are in this space, although no one else is aware of this, including your allies. After you are revealed, show the secret record to your fellow players.

If you take the Hide minor action while already hidden, designate new hiding spots in addition to your current ones. These spots must be veiled and reasonable, except that they do not need to be reachable from your current spot, but they must be reachable from at least one of your active spots. Once you have chosen the new spots, you may move into any of your active hiding spots as long as they are reachable from your current location. This allows you to carefully move while hidden, expanding the network of your potential locations the longer you go without being found.

## Interact

Interact with an object in your environment. You might pull a lever, quickly slash a rope, kick down a door, throw a torch or so on.

## Scan

Take a moment to learn more about your surroundings. If you are skilled enough to effortlessly learn about what you focus on, you may still have time to learn something else. Whenever you take the Scan minor action, immediately gain one of the benefits listed below. Then, you may roll the listed skill check. If the result is 15 or higher, you may repeat the Scan minor action (choosing a different benefit if desired).

- **Reveal, Focus (Perception):** Choose a hiding spot within 6 tiles and reveal it. You have advantage on this skill check if you are adjacent to the chosen tile, and disadvantage if it is more than 3 tiles away from you.
- **Size Up, Focus (Anima):** Learn the attributes, basic defense, special defenses, tier and turns per round of a creature of your choice.
- **Triage, Focus(Medicine):** Learn the percentage of life, percentage of essence and the number of stacks of exhaustion that another creature is at.
- **Classify, Expertise (Anima):** Learn either the arms, armor, or trinket affixes of a creature of your choice. If you choose to learn their trinket affixes, you also learn the skills that they are proficient in.
- **Identify, Expertise (Arcana):** Learn the details of a single power of your choice. You have advantage on this skill check if this power was used since your last turn or a creature is currently concentrating on the power.
- **Strategize, Expertise(Humanities):** Learn the tactics and motivation of a creature of your choice.
- **Scout, Expertise (Arcana | Anima | Fontcraft | Tinkering):** Learn the details of a vantage of your choice. If you do not specify a particular vantage, learn one of the worldspeaker's choice instead. The skill used depends on the details of the vantage, and is specified in its description.

**Obscure information**

Some information is, by it's nature, obscure or difficult to come upon. Even spending the time to investigate something, would not give a perfect idea of what it is. For example, if a monster has a strange machine attached to it, the knowledge of what exactly it does may be difficult to come to. This is typically what standard skill checks are for. The worldspeaker may call for a skill check to gain the information from the Scan action, in addition to the skill check to repeat the action. In this case, the worldspeaker **must** still provide some information on the skill check's failure.

</div>

If there is no more information to gain from the benefit you chose, you may swap it out for a different one for free. Mechanical enemies use the 0-cost _mechanical_ trinket affix, which causes the Medicine and Anima skill checks in this list to be made with Tinkering instead. Elemental enemies will have the _primordial_ affix instead, which changes those skill checks into Fontcraft skill checks.

Each creature's current absorption, as well as any conditions it may have, are always public information.

## Shove

Make a melee special attack against Prowess against a creature within your zone of control. If you hit, you may choose to either knock them prone or push them into an empty adjacent tile of your choice.

## Swap

Change the set of arms that you currently have equipped. This also allows you to completely stow your arms (and have no arms equipped), or draw them when you do not have arms equipped.

## Treat

Attempt to treat a creature within 1 tile’s injuries and ailments, curing a single ailment or mitigating a single affliction of your choice.

Select a ailment or affliction. If you succeed on a difficulty 10 Focus (Medicine) skill check, remove all stacks of the chosen ailment or half the stacks of the chosen affliction from them.
