# Reactions

## Attack of Opportunity

Strike suddenly, taking advantage of an opening in your opponent’s defenses. You may spend your reaction to make an attack of opportunity whenever an enemy in your zone of control **provokes** an attack of opportunity. By default, creatures provoke an attack of opportunity from enemies whose zone of control they are in whenever they:

- Lose life.
- Spend movement to both enter and leave a hostile creature's zone of control in a single turn. This occurs regardless of the order.

Unlike other reactions, **you may not use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity during your turn.** If you would like to follow up on your own attacks, pick up the [Ferocious](character-options/talents/combat-talents?id=ferocious) combat talent.

You may use any attack to make an attack of opportunity, so long as it does not cost essence and you meet the attack’s other requirements, such as being within range.

Attacks of opportunity always occur before the triggering action is complete. For example, if an enemy attempts to run past you, you could make a Grapple attack against them, holding them in place just before they leave your zone of control.

Attacks which hit more than one creature can be used as attacks of opportunity so long as they meet the other requirements. However, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls made in this way against creatures other than the one who provoked the attack of opportunity.

**Should I Dodge or Block?**

On their face, Dodge and Block seem very similar, as a defensive reaction to avoid attacks.
To help make this decision easier for new players, we've laid out their respective strengths.

**Block:**

- works on any attack that deals
- flat difficulty is easier to meet against attacks with a high roll
- most effective against large attacks, or multiple expected small attacks
- refreshing your reaction can be extremely effective for characters in the thick of combat
- will often result in you losing life still, triggering further attacks of opportunity (this can be helpful on durable frontline characters)
- scales with Prowess via your Prowess (Endurance) skill checks and arms affixes such as _brave shield_, _imbued shield_ or _towering shield_

**Dodge:**

- completely avoids attacks if it succeeds, rather than just halving them
- works on attacks that grapple you or knock you prone
- because you dodge an attack completely, your concentration is not tested
- because you dodge an attack completely, you do not provoke additional attacks of opportunity
- most effective against large attacks with low attack rolls (and so works well on characters with low basic defense)
- scales with Agility via your Agility (Athletics) skill checks and affixes such as _daring_ or _dodgy_

In short, if you are a burly frontliner, you probably want to Block, but if you're a lithe skirmisher or backliner you should lean towards Dodging. If you are a caster, pick whichever one is the least likely to cause you to lose life, risking your concentration and more attacks of opportunity.

## Block

Whenever you would be hit by an attack (after seeing the initial results of the attack), you may use the Block reaction. If you do, make a Prowess (Endurance) skill check. If your skill check result is at least 10, you **block** all attacks made against you until the end of the current turn. Halve the efficacy of blocked attacks made against you.

If your skill check result is at least 20, refund your reaction as well.

## Dodge

Whenever you would be hit a basic attack, Grapple attack or Shove attack (after seeing the initial results of the attack), you may use the Dodge reaction. If you do, make an Agility (Athletics) skill check. If your skill check result is greater than or equal to the attack roll that hit you, **dodge** the attack. Attacks that you dodge are treated as if the attacker missed.

## Track

When a creature uses the Hide minor action (including if they are already hidden) and chooses at least one hiding spot that is within 6 tiles of you, you may use the Track reaction. Like all effects with a range, this does not trigger if it is blocked by full cover.

Make a Focus (Perception) skill check. If the result is greater than or equal to the Agility (Stealth) skill check from their Hide minor action, all of their hiding places within 6 tiles of you are immediately revealed.
