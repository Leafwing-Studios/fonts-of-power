# Environmental Complications

## Tile Effects

While in combat, tiles are commonly modified in dangerous or interesting ways: sacred shrines, clinging fog, walls of fire and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as **tile effects.** Creatures moving by teleportation ignore the tile effects of the tiles that they cross.

Tile effects (including ground effects) are triggered when:

- a creature begins their turn in the tile effect
- a creature enters the tile effect for the first time during their turn
- a creature shifts out of a tile effect when it is not their turn

Occupying a tile effect when it is created counts as entering it.

Not all tile effects have an associated trigger, but this ensures that they trigger once for every turn that the creature takes, no matter how they end up moving.
Attacks that you make due to tile effects that you created triggering do not end your hidden status.

Various effects, from glue to oil slicks to pools of acid to thorny underbrush, cover the ground. Tile effects like these are classified as **ground effects** and as you might expect, creatures that are flying or aloft ignore ground effects.

The most common ground effect is **difficult terrain,** which is difficult to cross, due to obstructions, unsteady footing or something similar. While on difficult terrain:

- lateral movement costs are doubled
- these tiles count as 2 tiles for the purposes of forced movement (other than teleportation)

## Visibility and Cover

There are three levels of **visibility** that describe how well you can see other creatures or objects: clear, obscured and invisible. These descriptors are determined on the basis of both the character attempting to see and the target that is being seen: covering your eyes with your hands makes everyone else invisible to you, but not to anyone else.

By default, your target is **clear.** As your target becomes **obscured:**

- you have disadvantage on skill checks made as part of the Scan minor action targeting them, other than to reveal one of their hiding spots.

Once the target is fully **invisible:**

- you have disadvantage on skill checks made as part of the Scan minor action targeting them, other than to reveal one of their hiding spots.
- single-target attacks you make against them have disadvantage

**Light** is the most common and important driver of visibility. There are three levels of lighting: **bright light, dim light,** and **darkness**, which are all tracked on a per-tile basis. Creatures and objects are obscured while in dim light, and invisible while in darkness.

**A Light in the Darkness**

If you have the tools (or patience) to carefully track light levels during combat in your game, a few questions are quickly raised.

Every light sources have a **light radius**, and shed bright light in that radius, and dim light in that radius beyond that.
The light radius of common objects are:

- 1 tile: a candle
- 2 tiles: a small fire
- 3 tiles: a sputtering torch
- 6 tiles: a blazing torch, bonfire or lantern
- 12 tiles: a brilliant magical light, gained by the _light_ trinket affix

Players can create objects with up to a 6 tile light radius using **Prepared for Anything.** Lighting or extinguishing your own torch while in combat takes an Interact minor action, as does extinguishing a light source found in the environment (typically at melee range). Creatures carrying a light source can fight normally. Extinguishing other creatures light sources should be left to the _extinguishing_ affix, or similar powers.

**Shroud** effects, such as a cloud of smoke, rain, thick underbrush or fog make objects both within them and seen from within them harder to see. If a tile is **lightly shrouded**, objects within that shroud and objects seen from within that shroud are objects obscured. If a tile is **heavily shrouded**, the objects are invisible instead.

Physical objects can also affect visibility and, independently, provide **cover,** shielding creatures behind them from attacks. There are two kinds of cover, partial cover and full cover. Like visibility, cover is relative to both the actor and the target.

**Partial cover** is provided by things like castle parapets, a pile of boxes or a sturdy tree. While your target is behind partial cover, attacks that you make have disadvantage. Creatures that are at least one tile larger than the target grant partial cover.

**Full cover** is commonly granted by things like solid walls, closed doors or being inside of a monster's stomach. While your target is behind full cover, your attacks automatically miss, and you cannot target them with other effects such as when applying boons, creating ground effects or using the Scan minor action or Track reaction.

When an effect does not physically originate from the attacking creature, cover needs to be calculated with respect to the target and the source of the effect. This is an important rule when, for example, a ball of fire explodes in mid-air, or the ground becomes covered in a dangerous effect.

In general, when a creature is behind partial cover, they are obscured to you, and when a creature is behind full cover, they are also invisible to you. Transparent objects, such as windows or shimmering walls of force are an obvious exception to this. Unless specifically stated, you do not need to be able to see creatures in order to target them with an attack.

## Height Tiers

Sometimes, cover takes the form of objects that can be climbed on, such as boulders, furniture or terraced gardens. When this is the case, treat these environments as having several tiers of height.

Creatures can safely travel up or down a height tiers (either by forced movement or by willingly spending movement) by:

- spending two tiles of movement
- spending one tile of movement while flying or aloft
- spending one tile of movement when moving via teleportation

When you shift, you may travel up or down in this fashion instead. You cannot split your climbing over several turns: at the end of your turn, you return to the height tier of the tile that you are standing on. To make flying in combat more fun (and balanced), this applies to flying creatures as well. Flying creatures cannot increase their height tier freely, and are always considered to be at the height tier of the tile that they are above.

Edges between height tiers can be marked as **gradual**, which is useful when creating hills, stairs or ramps. Travelling up or down a height tier over a gradual edge costs only one tile of movement.

Spending movement in this way only moves you vertically; if, for examples, you are trying to climb on top of a table, you would need to spend two tiles of movement to move up, then an additional tile of movement to move from the tile on the floor to the tile above the table.

When determining ranges, treat tiles as if they were one tile further away for each height tier between the attacker and the defender.
Height tiers provide different types of cover depending on the relative positioning of the attacker and the defender.

When a higher tier is in-between the two combatants:

- If the defender is prone, they have full cover.
- If the obstacle is one tier higher than the attacker’s position, the defender has partial cover.
- If the obstacle is two or more tiers higher than the attacker’s position, the defender has full cover.

When the combatants are at different height tiers:

- When the creature on the higher tier is on the relevant edge of their tier, no cover is granted.
- When the creature on the higher tier is one tile back from the relevant edge of their tier, both creatures have partial cover.
- When the creature on the higher tier is one tile back from the relevant edge of their tier, both creatures have full cover.

### Falling

When falling from a higher tier to a lower one, characters take damage based on the height fallen. Jumping down to another tier inflicts falling damage but does not cost extra movement.

Falling deals 2d6 physical damage for each height tier that you fall, reduced by the result of an Agility (Athletics) skill check. For example, falling from the 3rd tier in an area, to the bottom (0th) tier would incur 6d6 physical damage. If you rolled a 13 on your skill check, the total damage would be 6d6 - 13.

Creatures that are flying or aloft do not take falling damage.
