There are three different types of conditions that might affect your character: afflictions, ailments and statuses. Conditions (including the number of stacks) are always public information.

**Afflictions** persist between turns, dealing damage over time that **triggers** when a certain course of action is taken. Afflictions are applied in **stacks,** which build up as you apply more of them but reduce over time (or when they are treated in some way). The first time during your turn that their trigger occurs, you take damage equal to the number of stacks of that affliction that you have. At the end of each of your turns, reduce the number of stacks each affliction by one. Damage dealt by afflictions occurs after the triggering event is complete, which is important for effects (such as the Treat minor action and rage) that mitigate their effects.

**The painful details of afflictions**

Afflictions, by design, may only trigger once for each turn that a creature takes. Sometimes however, the timing can get a bit tricky.

Many afflictions (such as _bleeding_ or _temperance_) specify that they trigger "the first time during your turn that [you perform a certain action]". However, if you gain an affliction during your turn and have not yet triggered that affliction this turn, you can still trigger it later in the turn (even if it's not literally the first time in the turn that you've taken that action). As an example, consider the following situation:

1. You have no stacks of bleeding and spend movement to attempt to retreat from an enemy.
2. They hit you with an attack of opportunity and apply 3 stacks of bleeding to you.

This leaves you with two options:

1. Continue your escape, and trigger the bleeding as you spend movement, taking 3 points of decay damage.
2. Stop moving, and avoid the damage due to bleeding.

**Ailments** stack in duration. While you have at least one stack of a particular ailment, suffer its effects. At the end of each of your turns, remove one stack of each ailment you are suffering from.

**Statuses** are common special effects (such as being flying, prone or invisible), that do not follow the rules of either afflictions or ailments.
They may be good or bad, and do not share a particular structure or mechanics. Their complete rules are listed here for easy reference.
