# Ailments

## Aloft

While aloft:

- You do not take falling damage.
- Melee attacks that you make have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- You cannot spend movement to move laterally.
- At the end of each of your turns, you may shift once.

## Banished

You are sent to a strange, alternate plane of existence. While banished, you can only interact with other banished creatures. Tile effects created by banished creatures only affect other banished creatures. Creatures who are not banished can occupy and move through the same tile as you and vice versa.

Other creatures may use the Treat minor action (or other effects which remove ailments) to remove the banished ailment, even if they are not themselves banished.

When this ailment ends, reappear in the nearest empty tile. You can still perceive things normally in both worlds while banished, and you can still be seen by creatures in the normal world.

## Blinded

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and all basic attacks against you have advantage.

You cannot use the Track reaction or the Scan minor action.

## Blunted

The efficacy of your attacks is halved.

## Chilled

You lose your minor action each turn, but like normal may spend your major action to take a minor action if you choose. Double all lateral movement costs.

## Crazed

While suffering from the crazed ailment:

- Whenever you would make an attack, the target is chosen randomly from those within range of that attack, excluding yourself.
  - When making a multi-target attack, select a creature at random normally. You must include that creature as one of the targets.
- At the start of each of their turns, you must spend your major action to make an attack.
  - If you cannot (due to no creatures being in range of any of your attacks, or the pacified condition), you first must spend movement to first stand up from prone, then move directly towards the nearest creature until they are within range .
  - If you still cannot, you take the Defend major action.
- You are treated as an enemy for all other creatures and vice versa.
- You must take attacks of opportunity when presented with the option to do so, and whenever a creature in your zone of control loses life due to a third party's attack, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.
- You cannot willingly choose to be hit by an attack.

## Cursed

You have disadvantage on all special attacks and all special attacks against you have advantage.

## Defenseless

Damage dealt to you cannot be prevented by absorption.

## Frightened

You have disadvantage on all attacks against the source of your fear. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know where it is. If a different source applies frightened to you, the object of your fear changes to the most recent source.

## Hapless

You have disadvantage on all skill checks.

## Pacified

You cannot make attacks (i.e. take any actions that involve making an immediate attack roll).

Whenever you lose life, remove all stacks of pacified.

## Rooted

You cannot spend movement.

## Taunted

Attacks that you make must target the creature that applied this ailment to you. You must take attacks of opportunities against that creature if able. If a different source applies taunted to you, the object of your ire changes to the most recent source.

## Withered

You have disadvantage on skill checks made to use the Break Grapple minor action, and Grapple attacks against you have advantage. Double all lateral movement costs.
