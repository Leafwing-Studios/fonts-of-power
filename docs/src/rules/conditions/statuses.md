# Statuses

## Death's Door

While you are at 0 life, you are at **death’s door** and cannot heal by any means. At the start of each of your turns while on death’s door, you must choose whether to slip safely into unconsciousness or to stay conscious.

While conscious and at death’s door, you must maintain your concentration at all times, lest your soul be consumed by the nearest fonts. Whenever you would lose life, you must make a difficulty 15 concentration check, but using Presence (Endurance) check instead of the normal roll. The outcomes are as follow:

- **Failure by 5 or more:** you die.
- **Failure by less than 5:** you slip into unconsciousness, and gain a stack of exhaustion.
- **Success by less than 5:** you stay conscious, but gain a stack of exhaustion.
- **Success by 5 or more:** you stay conscious

Remember that you have a penalty to all skill checks equal to your current stacks of exhaustion, including skill checks made to maintain your concentration.

Once combat (and other intense activities such as Chase Scenes) have ended, you automatically slip into unconsciousness as the adrenaline (or its strange analog) fades.

At that point, other creatures can attempt to Rouse you with a successful Focus (Medicine) skill check. The difficulty of this skill check is 10 + the number of stacks of exhaustion that the unconscious creature has.

If this skill check succeeds, you regain consciousness and stabilize at 1 life. If this fails, or if no one attempts to rouse you, you instead regain consciousness and heal (regaining half your life like usual) when the party next completes a rest.

**As a reminder, once you reach death’s door, you cannot heal in any way until you have been stabilized.**

**Monsters on Death's Door**

Monsters enter death's door just as any other creature would, but feel an added personal stake. Monsters in desperate situations will fight ferociously to avoid being absorbed back into their home font. While on death's door, monsters add their Presence to any damage dealt.

## Flying

If you have the ability to fly, you can spend half your movement to take flight. While flying:

- You do not take falling damage.
- Melee attacks made against you have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- If you cannot spend movement or are knocked prone you stop flying.
- You are immune to the effects of the aloft ailment.

You may stop flying at any point during your turn by spending 1 tile of movement.

**This is not a flight simulator**

In this game, flying (as part of combat) is deliberately unrealistic, optimizing for fun and interesting gameplay that captures some of the fun of flight in fantasy combat without destroying the game’s balance or grinding combat to a halt.

If you find yourself worrying about whether you can outrange the archers on the ground, or how movement speeds work when you are in fact travelling in 3 dimensions, or whether your character can really fly while wearing a full suit of armor: you’re probably operating at the wrong level of abstraction. Be generous to the players and monsters who have invested in the ability to fly, and don’t use combat rules to resolve scenes that don’t have interesting combat counterplay.

Falling damage is determined on a per-scene basis due to **vantages** present in the environment (see the section on Environmental Complications later in this chapter). Rather than worrying about the biomechanics of coconut-laden swallows, and the amount of damage that said coconut would suffer when dropped from a tremendous height (and the damage that a hapless victim would suffer as it landed on their head), relax and enjoy the fiction and fun of the game for its own sake!

## Grappled

You cannot spend movement.

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions. This is rounded down before being applied evenly to each creature.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) grappling you.

You cannot make Grapple attacks or use the Dodge reaction.

## Grappling

This status (and the grappled status of the creature you are grappling) ends as soon as you are no longer adjacent to the creature you are grappling.

Whenever you spend movement, you must choose whether to move yourself, or the creature you are grappling. You may spend movement to apply an equal amount of forced movement to the creature you are grappling, so long as they remain within 1 tile of you. Unlike other forced movement, this does not move you (but does move the rest of their grappling graph, if any). You may cause creatures to perform any action that costs movement in this way other than to go prone or begin flying: you may cause them to stand up, move up height tiers, rotate their position or so on.

Forced movement against you is divided by the number of creatures in your **grappling graph,** but drags all creatures in your grappling graph with you, maintaining your relative positions. This is rounded down before being applied evenly to each creature.

If you are flying, creatures that you are grappling are also flying.

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks except against the creature(s) you are grappling.

You cannot make Grapple attacks or use the Dodge reaction. You may end this status on yourself (and the Grappled status on your target) at the start or end of any of your turns.

## Hidden

While hidden:

- your position is concealed, but must be in one of your active hiding spots
- you do not impose disadvantage on ranged attacks to creatures in your zone of control
- you cannot shift

The hidden status on you ends immediately after:

- the hiding spot you are in is revealed
- you spend movement to travel laterally
- you make an attack against any creature other than yourself
  - attacks that you make due to tile effects triggering do not end your hidden status
- you apply a boon to any creature other than yourself

After you are revealed, you appear in the tile you chose originally and gain the **ambush** boon until the end of the current turn. When you have the ambush boon, gain advantage on all attacks. Some affixes make use of the ambush keyword to provide additional benefits.

Other creatures may reveal hiding spots by taking the Scan minor action or Track reaction. Hiding spots are also immediately revealed when they are no longer veiled, as defined in the [Hide minor action.](rules/combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions?id=hide)

## Invisible

You are invisible to all other creatures, causing single-target attacks against you to be made with disadvantage.

Hiding places are always veiled for you.

## Prone

You have disadvantage on basic attacks. Melee basic attacks have advantage against you, and ranged basic attacks suffer disadvantage. Double all lateral movement costs. Hostile creatures can enter your tile while you are prone, but may not end their on your tile.

You may stand up from prone by spending movement equal to half your movement speed. You may voluntarily go prone by spending 1 tile of movement.

## Unconscious

You may not take major actions, minor actions or reactions. You cannot spend movement. You do not have a zone of control. You cannot benefit from any of your senses.
