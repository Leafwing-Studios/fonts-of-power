# The Building Blocks of Play

_Fonts of Power_ manages complexity by combining simple building blocks into the content that really makes the game come to life. This chapter is designed to give you the vocabulary and framework that you need to understand the rest of the book, especially if you’re new to d20 systems or tabletop roleplaying games in general.

Feel free to skip this chapter if you’ve played other d20 systems before; the concepts here are covered in detail throughout the Rules section of the book.

Gameplay in _Fonts of Power_ follows the tradition set by other role-playing games: each **player** takes on the role of a **character,** narrating their actions in a setting of the **worldspeaker’s** creation. As you play, the worldspeaker sets the scene, describing the world that the **party** (the cooperating group of players) sees before them. The players then control the actions of their characters to drive the scene forward. The worldspeaker decides how the world responds in turn. This creates an ongoing conversation guided by the rules of the game. The table works together in this way to tell a story of their own choosing, watching as it slowly unfolds, building off of and reacting to each others’ ideas and actions.

Each participant in a game of _Font of Power_ has a domain where, within the rules of the game, they have absolute say over what happens. For the worldspeaker, this is the world itself:
what lies over that hill, what mysteries await behind the cellar door, and the actions of the monsters and **non-player characters (NPCs)** that inhabit the world. For players, their domain covers every aspect of how their character acts, their past before the game began, and how they feel about and respond to unfolding events.

The **rules** of _Fonts of Power_ are there to make the game fun to play and force interesting forks in your story. We roll **dice** as described by the rules to resolve dramatic and uncertain moments, where more than one path is both plausible and interesting. By agreeing to a transparent and predictable set of rules for how these mechanics work, we create a reliable problem solving toolbox for everyone at the table. Once you learn the rules, you’ll find that they provide internal consistency to the universe and help you plan what to do next.

If you’ve never played a game like this before, you should begin by learning some critical bits of vocabulary: those that determine who your character is and what they can do:

- **Attributes:** your innate capabilities and strengths. The five attributes are **Prowess, Agility, Expertise, Focus** and **Presence.**
- **Species:** the type of creature that your character is, whether that’s a human or something else entirely
- **Skill proficiencies:** the specific **skills** that you are trained in or practiced with.
- **Talent:** passive abilities that make you unique, selected when you first create a character.
- **Level:** an indication of your overall power, driven by the experience you have acquired through adventuring. As you level up, your **proficiency bonus** increases, making you better at combat and the skills you are proficient in.
- **Class:** the source of your magical power, growing in strength and versatility as you level up
- **Gear:** various arms, armor, and trinkets that your character can make use of. From a mechanical perspective, your gear is a set of **affixes** which act to define how they work.

Throughout the game, **dice** are used to resolve uncertain events. _Fonts of Power_ uses dice with different numbers of sides for different purposes. A standard convention for describing dice rolls is to use terms such as 1d4, 3d6, or 2d20. The first number denotes the number of dice to roll, the “d” indicates that this is a die roll, and the second number denotes the number of sides the dice rolled should have. In order to calculate the final result, add up all of the numbers rolled. Some examples:

- 4d6 indicates that you should roll 4 6-sided dice, and add up all the results. If you rolled 4 dice and got the following numbers: 2, 2, 4, 6, then the final result would be 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 14.
- If a description says something like “deal 2d4 + Presence damage”, roll two four-sided dice, and then add the result to your Presence attribute (even if it’s negative).

When rolling dice, this game will frequently use the concept of **advantage** and **disadvantage,** typically to reflect situational or temporary circumstances that make a skill or attack easier or harder than normal.

When you’re rolling with advantage, roll two dice and use the higher of the results. When you’re rolling with disadvantage, roll two dice and use the lower of the results.

_Fonts of Power_ has two main modes of gameplay: combat and adventure. These are powered by various overlapping **systems** (sets of rules) that lay out different options for you to take, and help determine the results of your choices. The following sections discuss those systems at a very high level, and show you how they are connected.

**Combat** is rich and detailed, carefully defined by mechanics in order to create fun and challenging gameplay that embodies the fantasies of both the player characters and their enemies.

**Adventure** is used to describe any gameplay that occurs outside of combat. During adventure, play is relatively freeform—heavy on roleplay that draws on the characters’ skills and motivations, and open to quick, creative approaches to sketching out environments and solving problems.

## The Basics of Combat

In combat, _Fonts of Power_ plays like a traditional turn-based tactics game. The rules tighten up and decisions become more structured in order to create engaging, uncertain, and immersive gameplay.

The ability for creatures to keep fighting is tracked by three abstract resources:

- **Life:** your ability to take blows and press on, eventually causing you to die if it drops too low. Every class has a way to spend essence to restore their own life. While you have absorption, damage that you take is subtracted from your **absorption** first.
- **Essence:** your reserve of magical energy. This is common to all classes and powers your magical abilities. When you run out of essence, you cannot use these abilities unless you **essence tap,** risking exhaustion.
- **Exhaustion:** accumulated fatigue and stress. You receive a flat penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks equal to your current stacks of exhaustion, and it can eventually kill you if it becomes too high.

These resources are replenished when you **rest** overnight, during which you:

- Recover all your essence.
- Heal for half of your total life.
- Remove one stack of exhaustion.
- Perform a single **downtime activity.** These tangibly reward background activities such as crafting, focusing on recovering or interacting with other characters.

The party can also spend **Resolve,** earned by **opting into risk,** to immediately gain the benefits of a rest (other than downtime activities) while out of combat.

During combat, creatures (as well as important objects and terrain in the scene, and any effects created) have a precise position on the **battlemap:** a square or hexagonal grid that keeps track of relative positions and allows for the measurement of distances.

<div class="infobox">

**Which type of battlemap should I use?**

Feel free to choose either a square or hexagonal battlemap; both work well for this game. If you have access to both, hexagonal battlemaps tend to work a bit better for the mechanics of combat, and are great for open fields and natural structures such as caves. Square battlemaps are a better fit when drawing buildings, as they tend to be made at right angles with straight walls.

When using a square battlemap, diagonal movement should be permitted. For this system, we recommend always counting diagonals as 1 tile of movement, rather than alternating as 1 and 2 tiles, in order to speed up measuring of distances.

This system also works fine on a gridless battlemap with measured distances, although it is considerably slower. Playing using only theatre-of-the-mind is not recommended during combat, as many important and interesting abilities and effects rely heavily on the details of positioning.

</div>

Time also works differently in combat. Every creature acts in a discrete sequence, one after the other, to ensure that combat is comprehensible. Every **round,** each creature takes a single (in general) **turn,** one after another, before the next round begins.

On each of their turns, creatures can (in any order):

- **Move** around the battlefield
  - You can split this up freely, moving both before and after any **action.**
- Take a **major action** such as:
  _ **Strike:** hit an opponent with their weapon.
  _ **Grapple:** pin their opponent in place.
  _ **Defend:** focus entirely on keeping yourself safe.
  _ **Use a power** granted by their class.
- Take a **minor action** such as:
  _ **Shove:** knock a creature down or push them into an adjacent tile.
  _ **Treat:** cure yourself or an adjacent ally of a ailment or affliction.
  _ **Hide:** attempt to make yourself unseen so that you can attack with advantage.
  _ **Scan:** find a hidden creature, or figure out something about the scene.

Creatures may also use **reactions** at any point during the round in response to events that occur in combat. You regain your reaction at the start of each of your turns. You might:

- Make an **attack of opportunity** to capitalize on an opening.
- **Block** to soften the blow of an attack that landed on you.

Almost every hostile action that occurs during combat requires an **attack** roll, which is compared to one of the target’s **defenses.** If your attack roll is greater than or equal to the appropriate defense of your opponent, your attack hits.

To make an attack roll, roll 1d20 and then add both your proficiency bonus and either your Agility or your Expertise, depending on whether it is a **basic** or **special attack.** Basic attacks are standard attacks using weapons (or claws, fists, etc.) that might be protected from by a suit of armor, while special attacks target a specific attribute and represent more specialized abilities, such as an attempt to shove a creature, grapple them, or affect them with magic. Typically, you add your Prowess to the damage dealt with any basic attack, and add your Presence to any damage dealt with any special attack.

**Basic defense** is determined by the armor you are wearing, your Prowess and your Agility. There is one **special defense** for each attribute. These are determined by your proficiency bonus, your corresponding attribute, and whether or not you are proficient in defending against that sort of attack.

Finally, there are three categories of combat-relevant conditions:

- **Afflictions:** gradual sources of damage that trigger when a certain action is taken by the creature suffering from them, such as spending movement or making an attack.
  _ Once per turn when the trigger is met, the creature takes damage equal to the number of stacks of that affliction that they currently have.
  _ At the end of your turn, remove one stack of each affliction from yourself.
- **Ailments:** standardized negative effects that reduce your effectiveness.
  _ Whenever a creature has at least one stack of a ailment, they suffer its effect.
  _ At the end of your turn, remove one stack of each ailment from yourself.
- **Statuses:** combat-relevant temporary effects that don’t follow the rules of either afflictions or ailments, but are still common enough to get dedicated rules.
  - Being prone, unconscious, asleep, invisible, or flying are examples of statuses in this system.

## The Basics of Adventure

<div class="infobox">

**Effective roleplay**

As a player, try to focus on actions that **add color and detail to your character, advance the current scene,** or **draw attention to something interesting.**

Involve your party by asking them for help, and bring the world to life by asking the worldspeaker questions about its details. Time and attention are scarce resources however; don’t dwell on the things that don’t matter, and be flexible in your plans.

When describing your actions, begin with simple, clean descriptions with hints of more depth, and allow others at the table to build on or inquire about those elements if it catches their interest. Don’t worry about getting it all out in perfect prose at the very beginning, or producing professional-quality voice acting.

Use these tips, and **chase your character’s dreams,** and you’ll soon find yourself caught up in the story as you explore the world around you.

</div>

While exploring the world and interacting with its contents and inhabitants, play flows fluidly between the players and the worldspeaker.

Whenever a character attempts something that is challenging or uncertain and there is more than one possible interesting outcome, characters use their **skills.** To make a **skill check,** roll a d20, then add the attribute most applicable to your method of approach, and then add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient in a skill.

_Fonts of Power_ uses a generous **degrees of success** system: falling skill checks (especially ones you are proficient in) will often result in a selection between a **setback** and an **opportunity,** allowing you to “fail-forward”. Perform exceptionally well and you’ll win a **smashing success,** completing the task and winning an extra benefit.

Skill checks play a critical role in **scenes,** dictating your progress or complications through various scenarios in a more game-like fashion. Scenes offer straightforward and interesting mechanics to structure the most tense moments during adventure. Rules for four types of scenes are included:

- **Attrition Scenes:** For when you will complete your objective eventually, but suffer consequences the longer it takes.
- **Chase Scenes:** For when the party or their adversaries are running away, either literally or metaphorically.
- **Deals and Ideals:** For negotiating with NPCs, winning their **loyalty** as you appeal to both their **self-interest** and **ideals.**
- **Trickery Scenes:** For pulling off tense capers and raucous shenanigans, completing a task in the face of rising tension while your party tries their best to distract your opposition.

As the party catches their breath, they’ll have plenty of opportunity to engage in **downtime activities.** Both your time and your hard-won **essence crystals** are valuable resources. Depending on which downtime activity you select, you can customize your gear, win allies, gather resources and tend to your wounds.

Many abilities, such as features of your species, items you may have, or magical powers from your class are also useful during adventure. Use their descriptions as a guideline for what’s possible, rather than a strict set of rules to follow, making a skill check when the outcome seems both interesting and uncertain.
