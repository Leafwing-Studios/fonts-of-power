# Downtime Activities

As the party rests, characters can choose a downtime activity that they would like to spend their time doing. Downtime represents a break in the standard action, giving characters the opportunity to spend time with each other, prepare for upcoming dangers, catch up on gear upgrades, or simply relax. Downtime activities provide excellent opportunities to develop or reveal character and the world.

<div class="infobox">

**Extended periods of rest**

If the party is resting for an extended period in a safe location, such as while they are in town, they may continue selecting downtime activities for each rest before they return to adventuring. If the number of rests is unclear, we recommend taking two downtime activities for the extended period of rest. For extended rests of this nature, we recommend performing small scenes, either based on the downtime activities themselves, or separate scenes in-between rests. These scenes help to break up the monotony of numerous downtimes, and keep the world from feeling stagnant.

If the party is taking an extended rest in a dangerous area, such as an aggressive font of power, remember that each rest triggers a one success attrition scene as the party risks consequences from the nearby threat.

</div>

There are several well-defined downtime activities within the rules for players to select from, granting fairly general and tangible mechanical benefit. While the downtime activities that follow are the most common and generically useful options, they are not intended as an exhaustive list. Other downtime activities should offer similarly tangible benefits, in order to ensure that the choice stays meaningful.

## Danger Levels

In the world of _Fonts of Power_, some areas are incredibly dangerous, crawling with monsters and bubbling with magical power, while others, such as towns, are quite safe. This is captured in the idea of the **danger level** of an area.

Areas with a higher danger level carry more risk but come with greater rewards. The danger level of areas is always between 0 and 3, and is readily apparent to all those who enter it.

The danger level of an area affects the following:

- If you rest in an area with a danger level greater than 0, you must complete a one-success [attrition scene](rules/scenes/attrition-scenes), suffering consequences if you fail
- The difficulty of skill checks during attrition scenes increases by 5 for each danger level
- The Harvest and Enchant downtime activities gain a bonus of +5 for each danger level
- Harvest can only be used if the danger level is 1 or greater
- Players can only be resurrected at a font from the area of highest danger. In most cases, this is the epicenter of the font.
- The difficulty of combat encounters and the amount of treasure found scales with the danger level, as described in the [_Worldspeaker's Guide to Fonts of Power_](http://worldspeakers.fontsofpower.com/#/)

## Attune

Forge a connection with pieces of magical gear, allowing you to tap into its magic. You only gain the benefits (or drawbacks) of any enchanted affixes of gear that you have equipped while you are attuned to it. When you use this downtime activity, you may complete change the items that you are attuned to, attuning (or unattuning) to any number of items up to your personal **attunement limit** of:

- two sets of arms
- one set of armor
- three trinkets

If you are already at your attunement limit for a particular type of gear, you must lose attunement to an existing set (or sets) of gear of the appropriate type to attune to a new set.

As you gain experience and learn to control your own magic, you are able to safely use more powerful magical items. You can only attune to a set of arms or armor if its gear point total ≤ proficiency bonus + 2.

After you perform this downtime activity, you are particularly in touch with your magical items for a short period of time. One time before your next rest, you may modify the result of a roll after you see its outcome:

- If you attuned to a set of arms, you may treat an attack that you made while you had these arms equipped as if you had rolled a 15.
- If you attuned to a set of armor, you may treat an attack that you made against you while you had this armor equipped as if the attacker had rolled a 5.
- If you attuned to a collection of trinkets, you may treat a related skill check as if you had rolled a 15. This is deliberately broad: if it is narratively plausible that the trinket could have helped you accomplish the task for which you rolled the skill check, you may use this benefit.

## Bond

Grow closer to another party member, improving your cooperation. Both party members must select this downtime activity in order to gain its benefits. Until you next complete a rest:

- you have advantage on any skill check made to attempt to help each other on skill checks
- you have advantage on any skill checks or attack rolls made to use the Treat or Break Grapple minor actions to benefit each other

## Challenge

Challenge an NPC to a contest of some sort, wagering that your skill is superior, and winning or losing the stakes of your bet based on the outcome. Mechanically:

1. Propose a method of contest for both you and the NPC, selecting both a skill and an attribute.
2. Propose a set of stakes for both you and the NPC.
3. Borrowing rules from the Deals and Ideals section found in the Scenes chapter, the NPC evaluates this challenge’s payoff and plausibility, accepting the challenge if their sum is at least 0.
   - You may use both Deception and Salesmanship to influence their perception of the payoff and plausibility.
4. Make an opposed skill check against the NPC.
5. If you win, you gain your half of the stakes of your bet. If you lose, hand over the stakes of the bet or their loyalty to you decreases by 1 or 2 due to Broken Trust.
6. If you win by 5 or more their loyalty towards you increases by 1, as you Earn Their Respect due to your superior skill. If you lose by 5 or more, their loyalty towards you decreases by 1 as you lose their respect through your abject failure.

## Connect

Improve your relationship with an NPC or faction by helping them out or building social ties. If you succeed on a suitable difficulty 15 skill check, their loyalty increases by 1.

## Craft

Attempt to create a mundane item, or modify the affixes of a set of arms or armor using exceptional craftsmanship.

In order to use this downtime activity, you must have access to both the appropriate tools and raw materials. You can get these by using the Prepared for Anything system and rolling the Supplies die. Tools are not consumed, but raw materials are, whether you succeed or fail.

If you want to add an affix to a set of arms or armor, make an Expertise (Craftsmanship) skill check, with a difficulty set by the rarity of the affix. If you succeed, add that affix to the item’s affixes.

<div class="infobox">

**Affix crafting difficulty by rarity**

- **Common:** difficulty 10
- **Advanced:** difficulty 15
- **Exotic:** difficulty 20
- **Prismatic:** difficulty 25

</div>

If you succeed by 5 or more, you may immediately gain the benefit of this downtime activity again, affecting the same item.

Regardless of success, you may remove any affixes from the arms or armor, letting you replace an affix with a new one to ensure that the gear point total remains less than or equal to your proficiency bonus plus 2. In addition, you may choose to immediately attune to the piece of gear you just crafted, replacing your attunement to an existing piece of gear of the same type if needed.

Creating mundane items or structures other than arms and armor requires an Expertise (Craftsmanship) skill check, with the difficulty set by the table in the usual fashion.

## Disenchant

Scrap an item completely, turning it back into essence crystals.

Choose a set of arms or armor, or a single trinket, and make an Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Arcana), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check. The item is permanently destroyed, and you recover essence crystals equal to:

**skill check result \* gear point total / 2**

Treat the gear point total of any trinket consumed in this way as 1.

You have disadvantage on this skill check if the item is marked by a different crafting skill.

## Devise

Create a small batch of consumable magic items for your party to use out of whatever you might have on hand, powered by their user’s own essence. These might be healing potions, a poison to coat your weapon with or a clever trap.

Design a consumable by selecting one base effect and any number of modifying effects.

Make an Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Arcana), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check. You create a number of copies of the consumable you designed equal to your skill check result divided by 5, rounded down. Additionally, you may spend any number of essence crystals after seeing the result of the enchanting skill check. Gain 1 additional copy of the consumable for every essence crystal consumed in this way.

## Enchant

Enchant an item, adding an affix to it by spending essence crystals.

Select a trinket, or an affix and a set of arms or armor. Successfully adding this affix to the gear consumes 10 essence crystals per gear point of that affix (to a minimum of 0) are consumed, transformed into the magic of the enchantment (but not lost if you fail). If the affix is prismatic, 30 essence crystals must be consumed instead. Creating trinkets always costs 10 essence crystals.

Make an Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Arcana), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check, with a difficulty of 20 for a trinket, or set by the rarity of the affix. Add a bonus of 5 times the current danger level of the area you are in to that skill check. If you succeed, create that trinket or add that affix to the item’s affixes.

If you succeed by 5 or more, you may immediately gain the benefit of this downtime activity again, affecting the same item.

If you have access to a relevant **source of knowledge,** you have advantage on this skill check. Each crafting skill uses a different source of knowledge:

- _Anima:_ you have free access to a monster (or some trophy from that monster) who has the desired enchantment.
- _Arcana:_ you have free access to some sort of book, teacher or other documentation.
- _Fontcraft:_ you are at a font of power that shares an element with the enchantment in question.
- _Tinkering:_ you have free access to an existing item with that affix.

You have disadvantage on this skill check if the item is already marked by a different crafting skill.

Regardless of success, you may remove any affixes from the arms or armor, letting you replace an affix with a new one to ensure that the gear point total remains less than or equal to your proficiency bonus plus 2. In addition, you may choose to immediately attune to the piece of gear you just enchanted, replacing your attunement to an existing piece of gear of the same type if needed.

If you succeed, this item becomes permanently **marked** by the type of magic used to imbue it, corresponding to the choice of Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering, replacing any previous **mark**. Skill checks made as part of the Disenchant or Enchant downtime activity that use a different skill are made with disadvantage.

## Harvest

Gather essence crystals from the environment around you. For example, you might process part of a dead monster using Anima, collect strange minor magical items using Arcana, tap into the font’s power directly using Fontcraft, or salvage scraps of machinery using Tinkering. You may only use the Harvest downtime activity if the current danger level is 1 or greater.

Make a Focus skill check with the appropriate skill, adding a bonus of 5 times the danger level of the area you are resting in. Gain 1 essence crystal for every 5 points of the skill check result.

## Prepare

Read a book, hone a talent, sharpen your weapon, practice magic, gather information from the locals, scout the area or so on. Once before the end of your next rest, after you see the result of an attack roll or skill check that you have made that is directly related to the training you performed, you may instead treat that attack roll or skill check as if you’d rolled a 15 instead.

## Recover

Focus on rest and enjoy yourself.

Remove an additional stack of exhaustion or restore half your maximum life.

## Resupply

Purchase supplies, borrow them from the locals or scavenge them from the surrounding environment. Reset the party’s Supplies die to a d6 and remove all existing adventuring gear that you have. The details of how and where you resupply influence the plausibility of having various useful pieces of equipment; it’s trivial to find firewood in the middle of a dark forest but quite hard to come across a new set of lock-picks.

See the Prepared for Anything section in the Gear chapter for more details on how Supply and adventuring gear works.

## Resurrect

<div class="infobox">

**Deadlier Death**

In less optimistic campaigns, the lurking threat of death serves an important narrative role, creating fear and raising the stakes. If your table wants to play _Fonts of Power_ in such a fashion, we recommend four, progressively more brutal options:

- Increase the difficulty of the skill check made to Resurrect creatures to 20 + your transcendence. This limits its availability significantly, especially at lower levels.
- Remove the Resurrect downtime activity completely. This keeps dead characters dead. You should probably have a back-up character ready...
- Creatures cannot choose to slip safely unconscious while at death's door; their fate is left entirely to the dice. Hopefully your allies can end the fight soon.
- Do not match the tier of the monster to the level of the party, or the number of turns per round to the number of players in the party. Instead, just put in monsters that make sense for the environment at the time. You did notice the rules for _Chase Scenes_, right?

</div>

Death is not always the end of the story. Fonts of power capture souls as they depart the bodies of the fallen, swirling in the magical vortex before they are completely absorbed. If their allies are quick and skilled however, they can coax that soul back into a new (or old) form, allowing them to fight another day.

Whenever a creature dies while at a font of power, they start to become one with its magical energy, eventually becoming absorbed. Each time the party benefits from a rest (including from Resolve) or fails a resurrection check, the dead creature gains one stack of **transcendence,** which represents the gradual absorption of their soul by the font. Whenever you gain a stack of transcendence that increases your transcendence to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Focus, you must make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check with a difficulty of 10 + your current transcendence. If you fail, you disappear as your spirit slips away forever.

As a downtime activity, your allies can attempt to **Resurrect** you. In order to use the Resurrect downtime activity, they must be in the area with the highest danger level of the font that absorbed you. Additionally, they must have an adequate **vessel**, as described in the table below. They then must succeed on three separate skill checks, with a difficulty of 10 + your transcendence. These skill checks always use Focus, but the skill used (and the species you reincarnate as) varies based on the vessel used.

**Resurrection Options**

| Species                      | Vessel                                  | Skill required |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Original                     | Original body                           | Medicine       |
| Undead (Eternal or Skeleton) | Another body                            | Medicine       |
| Fontborn                     | A badly damaged body                    | Fontcraft      |
| Awakened                     | An ordinary animal                      | Anima          |
| Undead (Spectre) or Slime    | None                                    | Fontcraft      |
| Automata                     | An inanimate object                     | Tinkering      |
| Sylvan                       | A plant                                 | Anima          |
| Crystalline                  | 10 essence crystals                     | Arcana         |
| Fae                          | Something from a wild place             | Anima          |
| Reclaimer                    | Something with a strong memory attached | Fontcraft      |

**Resurrection Example**

Consider the scenario where 4 party members are attempting to resurrect a dead ally. Firstly, the party must acquire a vessel and journey into the most dangerous part of the font. They choose to use the original body, but they take two days to travel to the font's center, fighting progressively tougher monsters on the way.

Finally, they reach the center of the font, which is a danger level of 3. When the party arrives, their ally has 2 transcendence. They have a focus score of 2, so do not risk burning away until they reach 9 transcendence (7 + 2 = 9).

The party immediately starts getting to work resurrecting their ally. They decide to all take the Resurrect downtime activity, for a total of 4 attempts. Because of the current transcendence and the chosen vessel, they all roll Focus (Medicine) against a difficulty of 12. After rolling, there are 2 successes and 2 failures. The two failures increase the target's transcendence to 4.

Then, because the party is in a danger level of 3 while trying to rest, they must perform a single-success attrition scene with a difficulty of 25. Unfortunately, the party fails, and they are forced into a tough fight by their worldspeaker.

After the dust has settled, the party completes their rest, and the target's transcendence increases one last time to 5. The next day, they all try to resurrect again, but this time against a difficulty of 15. They get their final success, reviving their dead ally.

Their ally returns as their original species with 5 stacks of exhaustion. Then, the party completes one last attrition scene as before, which they succeed without consequences. With their task completed, they return to a safer area to take a few days of rest.

</div>

Each ally may make take the Resurrect downtime activity during the same rest. This can dramatically increase speed and success rate, but remember that the target gains transcendence after each failure. As always, they must all chose whether to Resurrect _before_ any allies have rolled to see if they succeed. Then, all allies roll at the same time, tallying up successes and failures appropriately.

When you return from the dead, you immediately suffer exhaustion equal to your previous transcendence. Like usual, gaining this exhaustion can kill you. Any skill checks made to resurrect you after you have died due to the exhaustion of being brought back from the dead are made with disadvantage.

## Support

Help your allies with their downtime tasks. Make a Focus (Guidance) skill check, enabling some of your allies to either perform two downtime activities, rather than just one. The number of characters you can support in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down. Characters cannot benefit from this effect more than once per downtime, and cannot select either the Recover or Support downtime activities during a period of downtime where they benefit from this effect.

## Tend

Attempt to tend to illnesses and fatigue. Make a Focus (Medicine) skill check, attempting to speed the healing of some of your allies. The number of characters you help in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down. Creatures that you help, gain the benefit of the Recover downtime activity.
