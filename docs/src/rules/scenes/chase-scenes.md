# Chase Scenes

A chaotic pursuit through crowded streets, a grueling species through the jungle, or a methodical hunt across the desert can all be critical moments in a story. However, trying to run these scenes as part of combat typically leads to predictable and tedious gameplay, where the quarry can escape nearly guaranteed, or has almost no chance to escape. Roleplaying the actual actions of a chase, supplemented by skill checks or attack rolls, goes a long way to make sure this stays fun and interesting.

In _Fonts of Power,_ a chase scene can be initiated by either party attempting to flee the encounter (at the start of their turn, if in combat). When it does:

1. Combat stops immediately and a series of contests play out.
1. The prey chooses a method of escape, which is resolved as either an opposed skill check or attack roll from the acting party.
   - Always use the highest modifier in the group, whether that’s a skill bonus, attack bonus or defense.
   - You cannot reuse a method of contest which has already been selected, in order to ensure diverse tactics and narrative interest.
   - Smashing successes, where you exceed your opponent’s result or defense by 5 or more, count as two wins.
1. Then the hunter chooses a method of pursuit, using the same rules.
1. This repeats until a side has won three contests, or the other side has conceded:
   - **Prey victory:** they successfully disengage from the hunters and no further attempts to find the prey can succeed until the player characters complete a downtime activity.
   - **Hunter victory:** they re-engage with the prey and may start either a social or combat encounter which the prey cannot attempt to escape from again.

Here are some examples of how methods of escape or pursuit might look as a skill contests:

- scurrying through the crowded city streets with Agility (Athletics)
- exhausting your prey’s stamina as you chase them across the tundra with Prowess (Athletics)
- navigating through difficult or confusing terrain with Expertise (Fontcraft)
- climbing a cliff with Prowess (Athletics)
- hiding with Agility (Stealth) opposed by Focus (Perception)
- convincing townsfolk to hide you with Presence (Charm)

If your party has an attack or other feature that can slow down or otherwise hinder the other side, you may choose to make an attack using this feature against them. Describe this in narrative rather than mechanical terms and use only a single attack roll to do so. No damage is taken or essence spent as a result. If you hit, your method of interference was successful: they may have been blocked by a wall of thorns, gotten lost in the darkness you created, tangled in webs, tricked by your illusion or so on.

No matter the contest, you may drag one unconscious or otherwise immobilized party member with you per conscious party member. However, this can impose disadvantage on relevant skill checks, such as those made to run away or grant advantage on attacks your opponent makes against you.

Significant differences in movement speed of at least 2 tiles or other relevant tactical abilities (such as the ability to climb freely when escaping up a cliff) can also grant advantage or disadvantage and serve as excellent inspiration for methods of contest.
