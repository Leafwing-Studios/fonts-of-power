# Scenes
Sometimes free-form roleplay leaves us with a lot of questions about how the world should work, resulting in frustrating opacity or unsatisfying processes. In those cases, we break away into a sort of game within a game. These **scenes** have a different type of narrative flow and specialized sets of rules, and are designed to shift the focus in compelling ways without forcing the table to come up with a framework on the spot. You can think of combat as a scene as well, but because of its importance and complexity in Fonts of Power we address it separately.
