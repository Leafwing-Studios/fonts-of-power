# Attrition Scenes

In many cases, the drama is not in whether a task is possible, but in how painful the road to get there will be. When, with enough determination and time, the outcome is a foregone conclusion, use an Attrition Scene. The party must attempt to complete their task through a series of challenging skill checks, facing complications whenever they fail.

Whenever the party completes a rest (other than by spending Resolve) in an area with a [danger level](../downtime-activities.md?id=danger-levels) greater than zero, they must complete a one-success attrition scene to rest peacefully. If they fail, they still gain the benefit of their rest, but some complication occurs.

**When should you use an attrition scene?**

Attrition scenes function on pressure and the consequences of delay. As with skill checks, if the consequences for failure or delay are not interesting, then the Attrition Scene should be put aside, and the party should accomplish their task without ceremony. For example, the party may need a lot of time to repair a town's wall, but if the nation is at peace, there is no interesting drama to be found from slow construction, and there is no reason in the narrative for consequences to suddenly arrive. However, if the party is attempting to rest and construct fortifications at an aggressive font of power, then potential delays risk attacks or supply shortages. In this case, the Attrition Scene is a fantastic tool for the job.

In order to accomplish their goal, the party must complete a series of skill checks. They might:

- Use Prowess (Athletics) to break down a door.
- Use Focus (Fontcraft) to safely navigate through dangerous terrain.
- Use Expertise (Arcana) to research a powerful magical device before it can be put into use.
- Use Presence (Guidance) to win over allies to their fledgling rebellion.

Unless a complication rules out their previous approach, the party can continue to reuse it (or choose a new one).

The difficulty of these skill checks is 10, increased by 5 times the current area's danger level.

The number of skill checks required should be set by the table (the worldspeaker may overrule this decision in the case of hidden information) in one of three ways:

- **Fixed number of successes required,** with the number of successes based on the difficulty of the task.
  - **Impossible:** You cannot wear down the golem guarding you just by singing really annoying songs. This approach will never work, no matter how many times you were to succeed.
  - **Grueling:** Exhausting the castle’s supply of food will not be easy. The party must achieve 3 successes to complete the task.
  - **Challenging:** Blasting our way out of this cell will take a while, and might attract unwanted attention. The party must achieve 2 successes to complete the task.
  - **Straightforward:** There’s rumors of bandits along this road, but it’s not far to the next town. The party must achieve 1 success to complete the task.
- **Fixed number of attempts** allowed or required.
  - Your execution is scheduled for three dawn’s from now. The party has three attempts to escape.
  - There are three waves of monsters attacking this settlement; but you may be able to stop some with your traps.
- **Gradual success,** where the party can choose to stop at any time to take home the rewards they have won so far.
  - The party is searching the ancient ruins for clues.
  - The party is attempting to Resurrect their fallen companions using a profane altar in the heart of an ancient temple.
  - The party is holding their position in the caldera of a volcano as they attempt to Enchant magical items.

There are four possible outcomes, based on the result of the party’s skill check:

- **Abject Failure (Failure by 5 or more):** The party suffers two complications.
- **Failure (Failure by less than 5):** The party suffers a complication.
- **Success (Success by less than 5):** The party earns a success.
- **Smashing Success (Success by 5 or more):** The party earns two successes.

What those complications entail is up to the worldspeaker, and should fit the details of the scenario. However, here are some ideas to get you started:

- Reverse one of the party’s earned successes.
- Every member of the party gains a level of exhaustion.
- Reduce the size of the party’s Supply Die once.
- Something goes wrong, and they cannot continue to use the same method to complete the attrition scene.
- The environment the party is in becomes more dangerous in some way. Add a vantage, and increase the danger level of the area once.
- The plot advances, or the party’s adversary somehow prepares.
- They lose the trust of an ally, and their loyalty decreases by 1.
- Combat encounter!

**Interrupting Attrition Scenes**

Sometimes, an attrition scene will be interrupted or diverted to take care of another task. In this case, there are two options:

1. Pause the attrition scene, determining if and when any progress should be reset.
2. Extend the current Attrition Scene to include the new diversion.

For example, suppose the party is digging a tunnel under some enemy fortifications, but are having difficulty making progress. The party may decide to go find an ally to help dig the fortifications. The process of finding and making a deal with this NPC should be added to the current Attrition Scene, since it is working towards the same goal, but with a different method. Suppose instead that the party came upon a town in urgent need of help, and decided to leave their tunnel digging for later. In this case, the Attrition Scene should be paused. As a table, determine how many successes, if any, to reset based on the power and ability of their enemies and the time taken for the diversion.
