# Deals and Ideals

When one character wants something of another, a **deal** must be struck.
There are two phases in the process of making deals:
1. **The pitch:** the **active party** proposes a deal, and the **reactive party** evaluates the deal
2. **Haggling:** the reactive party responds to the deal. Counteroffers and persuasion occurs until either the deal is made or someone walks away.

## The Pitch

After spending some time determining what each side wants and what each side can provide, the active party (usually the player characters) proposes a specific deal: if the other party does X, they will do Y in return.
At this point, the reactive party (usually controlled by the worldspeaker) determines their **willingness**:

1. **Strictly Opposed:** the reactive party is unwilling under any circumstances
2. **Unwilling:** the reactive party is unwilling, but will tell the active party what, if anything would be needed for them to agree
3. **Lukewarm:** the reactive party is willing to agree to the deal, but on a condition of their choosing
4. **Interested:** the reactive party is willing to agree to the deal as it's proposed
5. **Excited:** the reactive party is very interested in the deal, and wants to go above and beyond the original terms

The reactive party's willingness cannot start at level 5, only levels 1-4.
When determining the willingness of the reactive party, make sure to consider:
- The potential gain/loss for the reactive party
- The likelyhood that the active party will be able to hold up their end of the deal
- The moral implications of the deed being done, and the ideals of the reactive party
- The loyalty that the two parties have towards each other (or any bitter rivalries!)
- How other parties may react to the deal

## Haggling

Now that the deal has been evaluated, both parties work to make the deal better for them.
During standard haggling, either party may propose a change to the deal or it's terms.
Some examples include:

- Increaseing or decreasing payment for work done
- Putting up some collateral upfront
- Adding additional requirements on what must be completed
- Adding additional restrictions on how tasks can be completed
- Promises to also do future work
- Restricting making deals with specific other parties for a period of time

In addition to regular haggling, the players may attempt to **persuade** the other party.
In this case, make an appropriate difficulty 20 skill check. 
Some examples include:

- Using Presence (Guidance) to appeal to the moral benefits of completing the deal
- Using Expertise (Any appropriate) to demonstrate the party's competence at relevant tasks
- Using Presence (Trickery) to lie about potential riches and rewards
- Using Presence (Charm) to increase their loyalty towards the party
- Using Prowess (Athletics) to intimidate the other party into agreeing

Then, based on the result of this check:
- **Failure:** Increase the difficulty of future checks to make this deal by 5, cumulatively. (Soft failures can still succeed at a cost or gain an opportunity)
- **Simple success:** Increase the willingness of the other party by 1 level
- **Smashing success:** Increase the willingness of the other party by 2 levels

This means that persuading someone gets harder the more times you fail.
Choose your skill checks wisely!
As an example, after only two failures, the cumulative difficulty will be 30, making a success only possible with a natural 20 *and* a fully maxed out skill.
After three failures, the skill check is impossible, no matter what you do.

## Resolution

After the haggling phase is complete, the reactive party either accepts the deal (perhaps after some ammendments), or walks away.
Any parties which made commitments must uphold those commitments.
If they fail to do so, they will have to deal with the consequences of spurning their partner.
