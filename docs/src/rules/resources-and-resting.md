# Resources and Resting

Your ability to keep fighting in _Fonts of Power_ is represented through three vital resources: life, essence and exhaustion.
Life and essence are short-term resources, and are automatically restored to full at the end of each combat.
Exhaustion represents accumulated stress and fatigue, and is substantially more challenging to get deal with.

## Life

Life is the vital essence of every creature in _Fonts of Power,_ representing their physical wellbeing and capacity to fight.
Life is quickly recovered as creatures’ innate essence mends them back into the form they are meant to be, leaving them whole but completely exhausted.

Your life can never go below 0: instead, when your life reaches 0 you enter [death’s door](../combat/statuses.md#death39s-door), and must choose whether to slip into unconsciousness or continue fighting while risking death.

Both player characters and monsters have 25 maximum life (although various customization options can change this).
In combat, it can only be restored through the essence tap action or consumable magic items.

Occasionally, the distinction between **losing life** and **taking damage** can matter. Damage can be **prevented** in several ways: commonly via resistance or immunity to a damage type, absorption, or the Block reaction.
Damage is still dealt (and taken) when it is prevented by absorption, but not when it is prevented by other effects.
This distinction can matter for various effects such as the [_absolute zero_](https://tools.fontsofpower.com/affixes/5f931ca80d201c0017655594) affix.

## Absorption

Creatures can gain **absorption,** a short-lasting replacement for life points that represents absorptive armoring or a protective force.
Damage taken is subtracted from your absorption before your life.
At the start of each of your turns (before any other effects occur), reduce your absorption by the amount of absorption you had at the end of your last turn, to a minimum of 0. Ordinarily, this just causes your absorption to be reduced to 0 at the start of each of your turns.
The only time this does not occur is when you gain absorption at a time when it was not your turn, such as when it was received as a boon from an ally.

Absorption gained can stack, increasing the buffer of life points that must be dealt with before you suffer actual damage. The amount of absorption that a creature has is always publicly known.

When you lose life directly due to an effect, such as the Touched's [Balance of Power: Companion](../../character-options/classes/touched.md?id=balance-of-power-companion) feature or the [_expose_](https://tools.fontsofpower.com/affixes/5f8b6b81205eef0017b64ad9) affix, this life loss ignores absorption completely.

## Essence

Essence is the magical energy of _Font of Power,_ permeating the world and pulsing through the veins of every creature, including your characters.
It is innate and omnipresent, but the concentration of it varies from creature to creature and place to place.
Too much essence can quickly make one sick, or cause other bizarre and unexpected results.
As your character trains and practices, they become more adept with essence, able to draw deeper from their own reserves and capable of handling more powerful magical items without becoming overwhelmed.

Essence is spent to power your class features, allowing you to cast spells or perform remarkable feats.

Each player character and monster has 20 + Focus essence, which can be restored by resting or using the Essence Tap action.

Magic is your very life force: you can always draw on more of it, but overusing your powers will leave you drained beyond saving or accidentally kill you.

There are three common ways to recover essence in combat:

- The recover action, which slowly and safely restores your supply.
  - This is a good, safe way to get the essence needed to use your powers again.
  - By default, spending essence and then using recover is less efficient over the long-run than pacing yourself carefully.
- The essence tap action, which rapidly recovers your life and essence but leaves you exhausted.
  - This should typically be saved for desperate circumstances: exhaustion is a very heavy price.
- Consuming essence crystals with the Activate action.
  - You can only safely use one consumable each combat: using more risks serious exhaustion.
  - Essence crystals can be a solid choice of consumable when you don't have any others to use, or on low Focus characters.
  - Essence crystals are commonly used in crafting and as a currency, so while you should always have some on hand, they're not free.

## Exhaustion

As your character exerts themselves, and pushes past their natural limits, they can become **exhausted.**
Whenever you make a skill check or attack roll, subtract the number of stacks of exhaustion you have from the result.
Exhaustion stacks indefinitely, but you must eventually start making Prowess (Endurance) skill checks or die.

You can suffer exhaustion by trying to stay conscious while on death's door, using the Essence Tap or Activate actions, suffering a serious and persistent injury or by pushing your body too hard.

Whenever you gain a stack of exhaustion that increases your exhaustion to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Prowess, you must pass a difficulty 10 Prowess (Endurance) skill check or die.

Remember that exhaustion penalizes your skill checks when doing so.
You may not choose to gain a setback or opportunity when you fail this skill check, even if you are proficient in Endurance.

The only way to recover from exhaustion is by resting, or by using the Recover or Tend downtime activities.

## Resting

Characters can recover their resources and shake off exhaustion by resting.
In order to rest, the party must be able to eat, sleep and relax (at least in a relative sense).
When you rest:

- Remove one stack of exhaustion
- Perform a single [downtime activity](../downtime-activities.md)

Whenever the party completes a rest in an area with a [danger level](../downtime-activities.md?id=danger-levels) greater than zero, they must complete a one-success [attrition scene](../scenes/attrition-scenes.md) to rest peacefully.
If they fail, they gain the benefit of their rest, then some complication occurs.
