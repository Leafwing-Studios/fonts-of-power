# Experience

As you adventure, your characters learn and grow from the risks that they take and the goals that they meet. This accumulated knowledge is tracked by the party and represented by **experience.**

At the end of every session, work as a group to **reflect** on the notable events of the session. We recommend taking notes in point form as a **game log,** which you can refer back to in case there are questions about the events of the past.

Work as a table to answer the following questions about the session that was just played. Answer the following questions honestly, then earn 1 experience for each question that you say yes to:

1. Did we **explore** the world, learning something new and important?
1. Did we **win someone’s trust,** causing their loyalty towards us to increase by at least 1?
1. Did we act according to our **ideals?**
1. Did we find, steal, craft, or earn **treasure?**
1. Did we end the session with **at least one Resolve unspent?** If yes, reduce the Resolve that the party has by one.

**Customizing Experience**

This experience system is one of the simplest and most effective levers to adjust to help this system fit your campaign.

The 10 experience per level default sets a pretty brisk pace, letting players explore the entirety of their class features in a single reasonably long campaign. For a more leisurely campaign, a gentler learning curve, or a more epic story, increasing this to 25 experience per level might work better.

If you want to focus on a different style of story than the optimistic, adventurous default implied, changing the list of experience questions or the trigger for Resolve is an excellent way to encourage players to play to the genre.

When selecting experience questions, try to ensure a tension between them, in order to frame interesting dilemmas for the party. Similarly, Resolve should be awarded when the players behave in a way that is somehow contrary to their self-interest: encouraging them to take the story in the desired direction when other considerations would discourage them from doing so.

Once you’re done with those questions, **discuss what you want to do next.** This is incredibly helpful for the worldspeaker, as it lets them prepare settings and situations for you to explore during the next session.

## Leveling Up

As your characters adventure, they will inevitably both grow and change, shaped by their experiences. When the party has accumulated **10 experience** since last leveling up, the entire party **levels up,** and each player character gains features and abilities as described by their class. When this happens, any extra experience is carried over, to be counted towards the next level.

When you level up:

- Gain all of the **features** listed in the next level of your class.
- **You may change up to two choices** that you made about your character in the past, replacing:
  - Your combat or skill talent
  - A single skill proficiency
  - A special defense proficiency
  - One option for a feature you have selected. Common examples include:
    - Which power (e.g. spell) you know
    - Which subclass you belong to
    - The details of gear built as part of one of your features, such as the wild combat talent
  - The value of one of your ideals, changing it by up to 2 in either direction
  - The values of two of your attributes, taking 1 point from a single attribute and assigning it to another.

**These modifications reflect your character’s growth and change over the course of the campaign,** rather than a retroactive change to who they were. If you wish to make a more significant change, such as to your species or class, ensure you have the table’s support. This risks more serious issues with story continuity and it may be simpler to instead create a new character.

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

When this happens, you should change:

- your proficient skill checks (proficiency bonus + attribute)
- your basic attack bonus (proficiency bonus + Agility)
- your special attack bonus (proficiency bonus + Expertise)
- your special defenses (either proficiency bonus + attribute or 1/2 × proficiency bonus + attribute)
- your maximum life, which should be 20 × (proficiency bonus + 1) maximum life.
- your maximum essence, which should be your proficiency bonus × (6 + Focus)

The following features also change, because they rely on your proficiency bonus:

- the maximum gear gear point totals of your arms and armor, equal to your proficiency bonus + 2
- the amount of essence you can spend with many of your features

No matter what you change, ensure that every feature you have is consistent with the new changes. For example, if you change your attributes, double-check that your maximum essence, defenses and attack bonuses are consistent with the new scores. Finally, remember that attributes are always between -5 and 5, while ideals are always between 0 and 5.
