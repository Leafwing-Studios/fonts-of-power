# Prepared for Anything

_Fonts of Power_ emphasises fluid gameplay over meticulous realism. Rather than carefully tracking every copper piece, torch, and arrow, the **Prepared for Anything** system abstracts over inventory management by allowing players to retroactively decide exactly what they have on hand.

While the party is assumed to typically have standard necessities such as arrows, camping equipment, and rations, other objects are more niche. Here’s how we handle the party’s shared supply of things like torches, bundles of rope, pieces of chalk and 10-foot poles:

1. Whenever you use the **Resupply** downtime activity, set the party’s Supplies die to a d6.
1. At any point while the party has Supplies left, a player character may declare that **I Should Have One of Those,** and check to see if they possess a certain piece of **adventuring gear.**
1. As a table, decide how plausible this adventuring gear was to acquire the last time you resupplied. Then, roll the Supplies die:
   - **Impossible:** There’s no way you were in fact carrying around an anvil. Nothing happens.
   - **Implausible:** Really? A 10-foot pole? Roll the Supplies die with disadvantage.
   - **Plausible:** I suppose you never know when you might need some rope. Roll the Supplies die.
   - **Sensible:** Of course you would have packed torches to explore this cave. Roll the Supplies die with advantage.
1. If you rolled anything other than a 1 on the Supplies die, you now have that piece of adventuring gear. Narratively, you remembered to pack it or were able to quickly improvise.
1. If you rolled a 1 on the Supplies die:
   - You do not have the item on hand. You may have not thought to pack it, left it behind or lost it in an accident.
   - Decrease the size of the Supplies die once, ordinarily from a d6 to a d4.
   - If your Supplies die was already a d4, you are out of Supplies and cannot declare any new adventuring gear until you Resupply.
1. If you fail to find a piece of adventuring gear, your party cannot search for the same piece of adventuring gear until you Resupply and must choose a different approach to solving the problem at hand.

This creates a sense of attrition and rewards careful planning (through increased plausibility), while encouraging creative thinking and avoiding the need to carefully track inventory.

When you use the Resupply downtime activity, the Supplies die resets to a d6 and the party erases any adventuring gear that they’ve declared, swapping it out for more suitable equipment for their next adventure.

While this system is deliberately open-ended, here are some examples of what adventuring gear might do:
