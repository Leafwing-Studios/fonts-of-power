# Resolve

As you play Fonts of Power, you will often find yourself pulled between two competing impulses: to do what your character would do, based on their knowledge and personality, and to do what you as a player want to do, because you can see the flaws in your character’s approach. Following your character’s impulses tends to lead to a more immersive and better-paced game, and often results in interesting plot twists.

We use **Resolve** as a powerful reward for this behavior, which represents the party’s capacity to push through challenges through their bravery and spunk. The party **earns Resolve** whenever the players **opt in to risk.** For illustration, this might be:

- taking on a difficult task
  _ helping a group of strangers in need
  _ pressing on to stop an evil plot even while their resources are running low \* hunting a dangerous monster for the sake of glory and treasure
- making personal sacrifices to follow your ideals
  _ letting a villain escape to save innocents
  _ donating a powerful magical item to a greater cause
- upholding your bonds
  _ mistrusting an enemy of your ally, even though you have no out-of-character reason to doubt them
  _ doubling back to save your loyal retainer even as the cave is beginning to collapse
- suffering consequences due to character flaws
  _ monologuing about your plan to the heroes that you have captured allowing time for their allies to intervene
  _ tripping at a critical moment due to an old war wound

The decision to award Resolve is made on the basis of rough table consensus, just like the rest of the rules. Resolve is awarded when the risk is taken, rather than when a task is completed or harms materialize. As a party, you may only store a **maximum of 3 Resolve at a time.**

As a party, you can decide to spend one Resolve in order to either:

1. Gain some of the benefits of a rest, while outside of combat. Each player immediately:
   - Recover half of your maximum life.
   - Restore any missing essence.
   - Refresh any abilities that can only be used a certain number of times each rest, such as the Activate minor action.
   - You do not gain access to downtime activities, trigger an attrition scene or remove exhaustion.
2. Fix the result of a single attack roll or skill check, treating the roll as if either a 5 or a 15 had been rolled on the d20.
   - You learn the immediate effects of that roll before deciding whether or not to spend Resolve.
   - You can spend Resolve to modify any attack roll or skill check, no matter who made it.
   - This effect ignores advantage and disadvantage, modifying the final roll.
   - Any modifiers are applied afterwards in the usual fashion.
