# Equipping Gear

Unsurprisingly, you only gain the benefit of gear that you have equipped. The details of how this works varies based on the type of gear, shown in the table below.

| Gear Type | # Equipped | # Attuned |           Attunement Limitation           |
| :-------: | :--------: | :-------: | :---------------------------------------: |
|   arms    |     1      |     2     | gear point total <= proficiency bonus + 2 |
|   armor   |     1      |     1     | gear point total <= proficiency bonus + 2 |
|  trinket  |     3      |     3     |                   none                    |

The gear point total of a set of arms or armor is the sum of the gear points of their affixes. You cannot attune to arms or armor with a gear point total more than your proficiency bonus plus 2.

When a character attempts to use something that would not normally be used in combat as an **improvised weapon,** work together to determine a plausible set of affixes for it. This may be substantially weaker than usual: improvised melee weapons that deal 1d6 + Prowess physical damage or improvised ranged weapons that deal 1d4 + Prowess physical damage with a 3 tile range are sensible defaults. Arms and armor that you are not attuned to are treated as improvised weapons, but recall that you can use the [Activate](../../rules/combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions.md?id=activate) minor action to immediately gain the benefit of the Attune downtime activity.

Each trinket that you might find has about the same amount of power, offering interesting out-of-combat benefits. You can always attune to up to 3 trinkets at a time, and always gain the benefit of trinkets that you are attuned to.

You do not need to attune to consumables to use them, and can use as many as you like, provided you can survive the [essence overload](../../rules/combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions.md?id=activate) induced by doing so.

**Unconventional Equipment**

The flavor details of gear in _Fonts of Power_ are deliberately very flexible: the affixes determine their function during combat, and how that looks in-universe should be left to the player (or worldspeaker) controlling the character.

If you're looking to build gear that doesn't follow the standard tropes, there are several particularly flavorful affixes to consider:

- The _adaptable_ armor affix lets you quickly swap arms back and forth, which is fantastic for builds that want to interleave natural weapon attacks.
- The _embodied enchantments_ trinket affix, which lets you rapidly move your arms enchantments around between various weapons.
- Various arms affixes with the _mode_ tag, which lets you quickly swap between different styles of basic attack.
- The _gallant_ arms affix, which is great for capturing the feeling of swapping between offense and defense as you swap a shield in or out.
