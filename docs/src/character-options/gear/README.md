# Gear

Treasure, magical trinkets, fantastical swords and elaborate suits of armor lie at the heart of the fantasy genre. *Fonts of Power* provides a robust affix system and allows players to freely flavor any items they might create, allowing your characterâ€™s gear to live up to your imagination while still integrating with the rules of the game in an interesting and fair way.

In *Fonts of Power*, there are three different types of combat-relevant items characters (and monsters!) can use:

- **Arms:** Swords, bows, wands and claws, for all your combat needs!
  - Each character can equip two sets of arms at once, and change which one they're currently using with the Swap action.
  - Arms enhance the power of offensive, defensive and utility actions, either mundane or magical in nature.
- **Armor:** Protective suits of armor, magical vestments and sleek black leather. Generally, makes you harder to kill!
  - Armor improve your defenses, protects you from conditions or makes you sneakier.
- **Consumables:** Powerful, one-off magical items like potions and scrolls that are consumed on use.
  - Once per combat, you can use the Interact action to use these. Using them more frequently risks exhaustion due to essence overload.
  - Player characters can create more using the Devise downtime activity.
  - As described in the Devise downtime activity, when you create more consumables, select a base effect and, optionally, a modifier from the recipes that you know.

When you make your first level 0 character, select two sets of arms and one set of armor from the Premade Gear list.

**Unconventional Equipment**

The flavor details of gear in _Fonts of Power_ are deliberately very flexible: the affixes determine their function during combat, and how that looks in-universe should be left to the player (or worldspeaker) controlling the character.

If you're looking to build gear that doesn't follow the standard tropes, there are several particularly flavorful affixes to consider:

- The _adaptable_ armor affix lets you quickly swap arms back and forth, which is fantastic for builds that want to interleave natural weapon attacks.
- The _embodied enchantments_ trinket affix, which lets you rapidly move your arms enchantments around between various weapons.
- Various arms affixes with the _mode_ tag, which lets you quickly swap between different styles of basic attack.
- The _gallant_ arms affix, which is great for capturing the feeling of swapping between offense and defense as you swap a shield in or out.
