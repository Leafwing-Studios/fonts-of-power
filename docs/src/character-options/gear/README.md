# Gear

Treasure, magical trinkets, fantastical swords and elaborate suits of armor lie at the heart of the fantasy genre. *Fonts of Power* provides a robust affix system and allows players to freely flavor any items they might create, allowing your characterâ€™s gear to live up to your imagination while still integrating with the rules of the game in an interesting and fair way.

In *Fonts of Power*, there are three different types of combat-relevant items characters (and monsters!) can use:

- **Arms:** Swords, bows, wands and claws, for all your combat needs!
  - Arms enhance the power of offensive, defensive and utility actions, either mundane or magical in nature.
  - Each character can equip two sets of arms at once, and change which one they're currently using with the Swap action.
- **Armor:** Protective suits of armor, magical vestments and sleek black leather. Generally, makes you harder to kill!
  - Armor improve your defenses, protects you from conditions or makes you sneakier.
  - Each character can only equip one set of armor at once: "armor" is an entire outfit designed to function as a whole, not merely a breastplate or fancy hat.
  - You cannot change which arms or armor you have equipped in combat: changing them out is complicated work!
- **Consumables:** Powerful, one-off magical items like potions and scrolls that are consumed on use.
  - Once per combat, you can use the Interact action to use these. Using them more frequently risks exhaustion due to essence overload.
  - Player characters can create more using the Devise downtime activity.
  - As described in the Devise downtime activity, when you create more consumables, select a base effect and, optionally, a modifier from the recipes that you know.

When you make your first level 0 character, select two sets of arms and one set of armor from the Premade Gear list.

## Enchanted arms and armor

The world of *Fonts of Power* is brimming with strange and dangerous magic.
By layering new **enchantments** on top of the mundane bases, adventurers can capture this magic in their equipment and prepare themselves to venture even deeper next time.

While finding or making your own enchanted equipment is essential to further success, magic can be overwhelming and dangerous for the unprepared.
Characters can only equip gear that has an **enchantment point total** less than or equal to twice their proficiency bonus.

This is computed by summing the enchantment point total of your equipped set of armor and the enchantment point total of your most-enchanted set of arms.
While you can freely choose to focus more heavily on offense or defense in this way, you'll generally want to ensure that the enchantment point total of each set of arms you use is the same.

## Customizing arms and armor

To make (or customize) your own gear, you need to understand the basics of affixes:

- each affix can either be used as an arms or armor affix
- each affix has a gear point cost; all of these are summed together to create the **gear point total** of an item

### Mundane bases

When you're starting out, your gear will be entirely mundane.

- the mundane base of each set of arms and armor is composed entirely of mundane affixes
  - these are simple, commonly useful and always available
- each mundane base must have a gear point total of two

You can create or alter mundane bases (including the mundane bases of enchanted items) using the Forge downtime activity.
Each character begins their adventure with two mundane sets of arms, and one mundane set of armor.

### Working with enchantments

While finding enchanted gear can be convenient and exciting, you'll soon find yourself wanting to tweak it to match the needs of your character or the challenge at hand.

Enchantment affixes can be added using the Enchant downtime activity.
By combining raw energy in the form of **essence crystals** with specific ingredients found by adventuring, you can add exciting and flavorful capabilities to your gear.

Enchanting needs to be done within a font of power: the dangerous energy swirling around you makes crafting much easier, and the unique magic in the ingredients can't survive outside of the font that they were found!

Enchantment affixes can be turned back into essence crystals using the Disenchant downtime activity.
