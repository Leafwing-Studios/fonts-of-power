# Gear

Treasure, magical trinkets, fantastical swords and elaborate suits of armor lie at the heart of the fantasy genre. *Fonts of Power* provides a robust affix system and allows players to freely flavor any items they might create, allowing your characterâ€™s gear to live up to your imagination while still integrating with the rules of the game in an interesting and fair way.

In *Fonts of Power*, there are three different types of combat-relevant items characters (and monsters!) can use:

- **Arms:** Swords, bows, wands and claws, for all your combat needs!
  - Arms enhance the power of offensive, defensive and utility actions, either mundane or magical in nature.
  - Each character can equip two sets of arms at once, and change which one they're currently using with the Swap action.
- **Armor:** Protective suits of armor, magical vestments and sleek black leather. Generally, makes you harder to kill!
  - Armor improve your defenses, protects you from conditions or makes you sneakier.
  - Each character can only equip one set of armor at once: "armor" is an entire outfit designed to function as a whole, not merely a breastplate or fancy hat.
  - You cannot change which arms or armor you have equipped in combat: changing them out is complicated work!
- **Consumables:** Powerful, one-off magical items like potions and scrolls that are consumed on use.
  - Once per combat, you can use the Interact action to use these. Using them more frequently risks exhaustion due to essence overload.
  - Player characters can create more using the Devise downtime activity.
  - As described in the Devise downtime activity, when you create more consumables, select a base effect and, optionally, a modifier from the recipes that you know.

When you make your first level 0 character, select two sets of arms and one set of armor from the Premade Gear list.

## Customizing your arms and armor

The world of *Fonts of Power* is brimming with strange and dangerous magic.
By enchanting their gear, adventurers can capture this magic in their equipment and prepare themselves to venture even deeper next time.

To make your own gear, you need to understand the basics of affixes:

- each affix is either an arms or armor affix
- each affix has a gear point cost; all of these are summed together to create the **gear point total** of an item

While finding or making your own enchanted equipment is essential to further success, magic can be overwhelming and dangerous for the unprepared.
When choosing a **loadout**, the **gear point total of your arms and armor must be less than or equal to 8 + 2 times your proficiency bonus**.

If you have multiple sets of arms equipped, use the highest gear point total of those sets.
As a result, you'll generally want to ensure that the gear point total of each set of arms you use is the same.

Modifying gear is done using downtime activities:

- **Harvest:** Gather an ingredient or essence crystals from the area around you. Each ingredient allows you to create a single, specific affix.
- **Enchant:** Spend an ingredient to add its affix to your gear. You can spend essence crystals to make this process easier.
- **Disenchant:** Salvage a piece of gear to recover an ingredient and some essence crystals.
