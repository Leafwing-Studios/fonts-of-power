# Creating Gear

Gear in _Fonts of Power_ is always one-of-a-kind, created to match your exact specifications in both its aesthetics and function. The statistics and appearance of equipment in _Fonts of Power_ are not tightly tied. The same item, in a mechanical sense, could be a mace, a sword, or a scimitar. When you craft an item, you decide on what it looks like and what it’s made of. Explore the affixes and available options to blend flavor and mechanics together, and create the perfect piece for your character's fantasies.

## Building on a Base

Arms and armor begin with a **base,** which is modified by any affixes that you add.

The base used for arms is:

- Damage: 1d8 + Prowess physical damage
- Range: Melee
- Gear Points: 0

The base used for armor is:

- Basic defense: 10 + Prowess + Agility
- Gear points: 0

**Essence crystals**

Enchanting gear requires essence crystals, the most important currency used by adventurers in Fonts of Power. Densely concentrated crystals of magical energy about the size of a marble, they hum and glow faintly with power.

Essence crystals are essential for the creation and modification of magical items. Condensed magic in its purest form, they can only be acquired by venturing into the dangerous fonts of power that dot the world’s landscape, braving the monsters within as you explore its past.

## The Process of Crafting

You can create, modify and deconstruct mundane and magical items during downtime activities:

- **Harvest:** Gather essence crystals.
- **Craft:** Add, remove or modify affixes using mundane Craftsmanship. This is cheaper but more challenging than Enchant.
- **Enchant:** Tap into the magic of the fonts to spend essence crystals to add or modify affixes.
- **Disenchant:** Turn an item back into essence crystals.
- **Devise:** Create consumables for your party to use.

Lend a hand, make a deal or beg a favor; by combining your skills with your allies you’ll get the work done in no time. For detailed information on how this works, reference the [Downtime Activities](rules/downtime-activities.md) chapter.

## Affixes

You can find the complete, searchable list of affixes for this game [here.](https://tools.fontsofpower.com/affixes)

Several common affixes speak of increasing or decreasing the size of a die. To do so, change the number of sides on the die rolled by 2. For example, increasing the damage die once for a weapon that deals 1d8 damage increases its damage to 1d10. If your weapon deals more than one die of damage, increasing or decreasing its damage die changes only one die at a time. Dice can never drop below a d4; affixes which would cause this to occur cannot be added.
