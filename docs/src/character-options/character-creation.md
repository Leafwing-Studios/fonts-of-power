# Character Creation

As a player, the most important first step you need to take before starting a game of Fonts of Power is creating a character of your own. Before setting your heart on a particular character, find out more!

- As a table, discuss the **tone** and **style** of the campaign you want to run.
- Ask your worldspeaker questions about the **setting** to help ground your character in the world.
- Collaborate with the other players, and learn about the rest of your **party** as they’re forming.
- Figure out how your characters know each other, and **why everyone chooses to work together.**

Now that you have a sense of the context, find a seed for your character to grow from; an interesting idea, a piece of media or art that inspires you, or a mechanic that you want to focus on. Whenever you’re confronted with a choice, having a clear seed will help you decide which one fits who they are. If you’re struggling to find one, try answering this question: **why do you explore?**

With this seed in place, you can begin to flesh out your character, and fill out your character sheet.

Character creation in *Fonts of Power* is split into three stages, allowing new players to start playing faster:

- **Level 0:** the very basics needed to start playing the game
- **Level 1:** the crunchy customization needed to start exploring the richness of the systems
- **Flavor:** the interesting details that motivate your character and bring them to life

If this is your first time playing *Fonts of Power*, you should start at level 0, and run a one-session adventure to help everyone get comfortable with the mechanics.
Then, graduate your characters to level 1 and begin in earnest!

More experienced tables may prefer to start directly at level 1 (or even higher levels), depending on the story you wish to explore.

Either way, the details in the *Flavor* section of character creation tend to be less pressing and more narrative.
Other than ideals, none of them will have direct mechanical effect.
Feel free to fill this section out gradually as you discover who your characters are!

## Level 0

When making a level 0 character, you need to pick:

- Species
  - Select a species.
  - In most cases, select a subspecies.
  - Make any other choices defined there.
- Attributes
  - Choose any combination of attributes such that their total is +5.
  - Alternatively, for each attribute, roll 1d6 - 1d6 + 1. Reroll all attributes if the total is not between +0 and +10.
- Skills
  - Select any 5 skills.
- Starting gear
  - Pick two of the starting sets of arms.
  - Pick one of the starting sets of armor.

Add these to your character sheet and that's all the choices you need to make!

Finally, finish your basic character sheet by computing your **vital statistics:**

- **Proficiency bonus:** +1 at level 1
- Determine your defenses:
  - **Basic defense:** 10 + Prowess + Agility, or 10 + Agility + any relevant armor affixes
  - **Special defenses:** 10 + proficiency bonus + the corresponding attribute
- **Basic attack bonus:** proficiency bonus + Agility
- **Special attack bonus:** proficiency bonus + Expertise
- **Maximum life:** 25
- **Maximum essence:** 20 + 2 * Focus

You're now ready to explore the world of *Fonts of Power*.

## Level 1

When you're ready to level up to level 1, select a class.
Characters in *Fonts of Power* only have one class, but don't worry: each finished character will feel very different from others of the same class.

Then, look at your class table and gain all of the features provided at level 1.
All classes provide some variation of the following benefits at level 1:

- you learn how to use your powers: magical actions that you can take, allowing to spend essence for some extra power
  - for most classes, you will need to select some number of powers from the power lists associated with your class
- gain one or more passive features, that improve the flexibility or ergonomics of playing your character in combat
- select some form of subclass, helping define the flavor and role that your character will play
- select one exploration and one combat feat that make your character unique
  - feats can be chosen from the universal list, your species list, or your class list
  - exploration feats and combat feats are not interchangeable; you must always pick one of each
- increase your proficiency bonus by 1

Each time you level up, gain all of the class features granted by the next level of your class as shown in the class table.

Finally, now that you've gotten a bit of experience with the system, feel free to customize the mundane properties of your starting gear using the affix system.
See the [Gear](gear/README.md) chapter for more details.

## Flavor

As you play the game with your party and discover who your character is, try to fill out the following sections on your character sheet:

- Your **name.**
  - If you'd prefer an immersive name, see the section in your species description on naming for some conventions.
- Your **ideals,** which describe their personal moral code.
  - Assign each of the five ideals a value between 0 and 5.
  - This will have mechanical impact: it is easier to convince NPCs if your ideals align with what you're saying.
- Your **backstory,** outlining their life before the game began.
  - See the tables below, as well as the tables at the start of your class and species descriptions, for some interesting starter questions.
- Your **appearance,** which captures what others first impressions might be.
  - What do others see when you walk into the room?
  - What is your personality like?

### Backstory

Every character in the game has a past, events and connections and ideals from before the game begins to tell their story that influences their behavior and ties them to the world. As you work out their backstory, take notes on the ideas you come up with to share with the worldspeaker and other players in the game. Feel free to leave your backstory fairly vague, and fill in the details as the story of your campaign unfolds.

Begin by working with your worldspeaker and the other players in your party to determine how everyone met, and what ties them together even in the face of danger and hardship. Several reasonable starting points are listed in the table below, with the tables beneath that expanding on those options. If you’re not sure what sort of campaign you’d like to play, the answer to this question can be a great place to start.

With the party’s purpose established, each species and class has tables that pose a number of questions that relate to the fundamental identity and dilemmas posed by your character’s species and class. These can be excellent prompts for forming a high-level picture of the type of story you want your character to have.

From there, think about what their life before adventuring was like.

- Where did they grow up?
- What was their family and community like?
- How does your character feel about them now?
- Did your character learn a trade or profession?
- What hobbies and interests do they have?
- What were the lowest and highest moments of their life so far?
- Who do they know from before the story began who might be emotionally significant, a valuable ally or an interesting rival or enemy?

Finally, think about the questions most pertinent to their life as an adventurer, tying together their past and explaining how they mesh with the party.

- How did they gain their magical powers that they develop through their class?
- How do they feel about these powers?
- What sort of moral standards do they hold themselves and others to?
- What ideals do they pursue, even when it’s inconvenient?
- What flaws do they struggle with that tend to land them in trouble?
- Why are they adventurers, rather than living a quiet life?
