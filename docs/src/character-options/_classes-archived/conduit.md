# Conduit

**Source of Power:** Conduits collect and focus the ambient magic of their surroundings, carefully channeling this magic into items before releasing it in a surge of power.

**Core Mechanic:** The charges that conduits cast can be directed into their weapons instead, imbuing their basic attacks with incredible magic that chains between their foes.

**Specialization:** Conduits learn to master specific enchantments, permanently gaining the effect of specific affixes as they level up.

**Approach to Adventure:** The Conduit’s skill in temporarily imbuing items with magic transfers naturally to doing so permanently, lending them a distinct advantage during various downtime activities related to enchanting.

**Build Fundamentals:** Whether they are shooting arrows of light at the enemy or wielding a flaming sword, Conduits make excellent strikers, with the option to focus more heavily on control if they so choose:

- Striker: Opt into the risky double-edged charges like roar of fire to maximize your output, then select armor affixes like _immunity_ to mitigate their downsides.
- Controller: Double down on your ailments, selecting affixes like _imbued strikes_ and _merciless_ to apply more of them and then amplify their effects with exotic affixes like _absolute zero_.

## Conduit Casting

Conduits fight by channeling their **charges** into their weaponry, releasing them in an explosive show of force when they strike their foes.

At level 1, whenever you cast a charge, you may choose to channel it into your weapon instead. The charge persists in your weapon until you hit a creature with a basic attack using that weapon or complete a rest. When you attempt a basic attack with that weapon, the charge discharges, affecting the creature if you strike and fizzling harmlessly if you miss. No additional special attack is required for the charge, even if it would normally have one.

Each set of arms may only hold one charge at a time. Casting any further charges into it causes the previous charge to fizzle away harmlessly. Your holstered weapons can continue to hold stored charges.

Once per turn, without spending an action, you may spend 1 essence to cast a charge into your weapon.

In addition, you may spend 1 essence to use **Charge** minor action. When you do, choose whether to cast the charge into your weapon or directly at a target of your choice within range.

You learn 4 charges at level 1 selected from the [Conduit Charges](../powers/conduit-charges.md) section of the book. You learn an additional charge at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19.

## Mastery: Weaponry

The Conduit’s talents with the infusion of magic transfer naturally to the creation and modification of magical equipment. At level 1, you also gain the ability to permanently imbue any set of weaponry you wield with a form of enchantment that you have mastered.

When you gain this feature, select a non-prismatic arms affix with a gear point cost of 1. Arms that you wield automatically gain the benefit of this affix.

## Persistence

When you reach level 2, you are able to use your ability to channel your own energy into permanent magical items. The first time each rest that you use the Enchant downtime activity, you may spend 1 essence to replace 1 essence crystal of its cost, up to a maximum of twice your proficiency bonus.

## Reverse Polarity

Also at level 2, you learn to absorb the effects of magical attacks directed at you, attempting to heal your wounds with their power rather than just dodge their impact.

As a reaction whenever a special attack misses you, you may spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to gain life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus. If you do so, you suffer no other harmful effects from the attack, even if you otherwise would.

## Injection Attack

At level 3, you learn to suddenly appear in the fray of battle on the back of your attacks. Whenever you strike a creature with an attack (including any of your charges) you may choose to teleport into an empty tile of your choice that is adjacent to that creature. If you do, you may not spend movement until the start of your next turn.

## Circuit Breaker

At level 3, you have learned to halt your magical energy in its tracks when your attacks go off course. charges that are channeled into your arms are no longer lost when your empowered basic attack misses.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Buffer Overflow

Once you reach level 5, you learn to chain energy through your enemies as the magic leaps between them. Once per round when you use your Conduit Casting class feature and hit with an imbued basic attack or charge that was cast directly, you may choose to spend 1 additional essence to cause the magic to chain into another nearby target.

Each new target must be within 2 tiles of the previous one, and the chain can contain up to two targets total. Creatures can only be part of each chain once; you cannot return to them. You must hit targets beyond the first that the magic jumps to with the special attack specified in the charge description, even if you use this feature as part of an imbued basic attack.

Spells copied in this way remain single-target, allowing them to gain the full benefit of effects such as the _imbued thaumaturgy_ affix.

The total number of creatures hit in this chain increases to 3 at level 9, 4 at level 13 and 5 at level 17. You must pay one essence for each jump made.

## Static Analysis

When you reach level 6, you are able to analyze magical designs without needing to risk testing them yourself. Whenever you use the Scan minor action on a magic item or monster power, you immediately know what affixes the item has or the full text of the power.

## Mastery: Armor

At level 7, you master a technique of magical armorsmithing. You gain the ability to permanently imbue any set of armor you wield with a form of enchantment that you have mastered. When you gain this feature, select a non-prismatic armor affix with a gear point cost of 1. You automatically gain the benefit of this affix.

## Inner Loop

At level 9, you can cause your Buffer Overflow feature to chain to the same target multiple times (including immediately after affecting that target). Roll each attack separately.

## Surge Protection

At level 10, you are able to handle unusual amounts of magical energy safely. You may use the Activate minor action once more per rest before needing to make a Focus (Arcana) skill check to avoid essence overload. You have advantage on all skill checks made to create consumables during the Devise downtime activity.

## Exception Handling

When you reach level 11, you learn to recover gracefully from unexpected failure. Once per rest, you may treat a skill check made as part of combat as if you had rolled a 15 after you see its results.

## Arcing

At level 13, your magic flows more readily between your targets. Your charges may now chain between creatures that are up to 4 tiles away from the last creature in the chain, rather than being limited to 2 tiles when you use the Buffer Overflow class feature.

## Mastery: Trinket

Once you reach level 14, you learn to master the use of magical trinkets, effortlessly taking full advantage of your collection. You may attune to 4 trinkets at once, rather than the usual 3. Once per rest when you use the Activate minor action to gain the benefits of the Attune downtime activity, it does not count toward essence overload.

## GOTO

At level 15, you are a master of strange nonlinear paths. You are no longer prevented from spending movement after teleporting using your Injection Attack feature.

## Multithreading

At level 17, you learn to branch your magic, executing multiple targets in parallel. When you use your Buffer Overflow feature, you may choose to branch the chain at any point, affecting multiple creatures from the same source (including from yourself).

## Stack Overflow

When you reach level 18, you have access to an incredible but diffuse repository of information, drawing upon the wisdom of those who have come before you. You are always treated as if you have an extra source of knowledge for the Enchant downtime activity. Advantage on your skill checks made as part of the Enchant downtime activity now stacks; you may roll an additional d20 for each separate source of advantage, taking the highest result as usual. Like usual, advantage gained in this way is cancelled by disadvantage on a one-for-one basis.

## Overclock

At level 20, the Conduit is capable of using a third, incredibly powerful prismatic enchantment without being melted by the intense magic. You may equip a total of three prismatic affixes at one time, rather than the standard limit of two. Like always, you cannot equip more than one prismatic affix from a single type of gear at once.
