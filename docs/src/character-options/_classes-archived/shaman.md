# Shaman

**Source of Power:** Drawing magical power from the land itself, Shamans manifest these primal energies with uncontrolled destructive force.

**Core Mechanic:** While Shamans are capable of spending essence at an unparalleled rate to empower their flexible manifestations, they risk being overloaded with elemental energy in return, suffering intense, unpredictable elemental damage whenever they exceed their capacity.

**Specialization:** Each Shaman is affiliated with a particular Domain: a component of the natural environment that determines the type of elemental damage that they deal, along with the details of their manifestations.

**Approach to Adventure:** Shamans’ connection to nature gives them the ability to speak to the wildlife, plants and eventually even land around them. By tapping into the earth itself, they also gain the power to map their surroundings at a distance, making them exceptionally useful when exploring dangerous new places.

**Build Fundamentals:** With the help of their incredibly versatile manifestations, shamans can just as easily be powerful strikers hurling raw elemental force, subtle controllers of the battlefield, or ally-warding guardians:

- Striker: Focus on either the _blade_ or _blast_ manifestation to ensure you can put out consistent damage, then lay down a _storm_ to funnel your enemies exactly where you want them.
- Controller: The _shaping_ and _breath_ manifestations are your best friends, especially when combined with either the _grasp_ or _word_ manifestations, letting you choke out your enemies options and control the whole battlefield from a distance.
- Guardian: Try to pick up the _expel_ and _shelter_ manifestations to support your allies and protect them from your wrath. Selecting _shield_ as your characteristic manifestation is another great choice, letting you block blows for your allies.

## Manifestations

The elemental power wielded by the Shaman is a product of their deeply personal relationship with the land; no two Shaman’s are truly alike. **Manifestations,** which allow you to shape and wield the elements in powerful but dangerous ways, growing as you pour more energy into them.

You learn 3 manifestations at level 1 selected from the [Shaman Manifestations](../powers/shaman-manifestations.md) section of the book. You learn an additional manifestation at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19.

## Domain

Every Shaman has a special connection to a particular type of place, and the elemental energy that embodies it. At level 1, select your **Domain** from the list given at the end of this class section. Your choice determines the type of damage they deal, the details of some of their manifestations, and the types of places they are most familiar with.

When a Manifestation is said to deal **elemental damage,** substitute the appropriate elemental damage type specified by your Domain.

You always have resistance to this type of elemental damage, and cannot become immune (or vulnerable) to it.

## Surge

When you use a manifestation, you may choose to spend additional essence to **surge** it. Every even point of Surge increases the direct potency of the effect, and every odd point increases their power in a more subtle way.

Every point of essence that you spend in this way increases your **energy** by one. Your **capacity** is equal to twice your proficiency bonus; you cannot spend essence to Surge a manifestation if it would cause your energy to exceed your capacity.

At the start of each of your turns:

- compute the difference between your energy and your proficiency bonus as your **excess energy**
- take 2d12 elemental damage (of the type associated with your Domain) for each point of excess energy
- you cannot change the type of damage dealt by this effect, but (through your Domain class feature) are resistant to this damage
- reset your energy to 0

In addition, you no longer provoke an attack of opportunity or test your concentration when you lose life due to taking damage of the type associated with your Domain.

## Lay of the Land

At level 2, you learn to tap into the primal energy of the land; allowing you to gain a high-level overview of the nearest font of power.

You gain access to the Commune downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, you learn the following facts about the nearest font of power:

- the range of danger levels present in that font
- the elements it is associated with
- the zones that make up the font, their connections and their danger level
- any font-level vantages, which modify the rules of the game for creatures in that font of power

You may also make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check at this time. You learn information about the font's origin, status and goals based on the result of your skill check according to the worldspeaker's discretion. You may repeat this skill check each time that you complete the Commune downtime activity.

## Regeneration

Also at level 2, the energy created through the use of your abilities revitalizes you as you reabsorb it. At the start of each of your turns, gain 2 absorption and regain 2 life for each point of energy that you had.

As both this effect and the damage from your Surge class feature occur at the start of your turn, you may choose whether this absorption and healing occurs before or after you take that damage.

## Characteristic Manifestation

At level 3, you have developed a particular affinity for one particular form of manifesting your power. Select a manifestation that you know. This manifestation becomes more versatile, as detailed in the Characteristic Manifestation section of its description.

At level 15, select a second characteristic manifestation.

## Energy Cycle

Also at level 3, you learn to absorb magical power directed at you, fueling your abilities. Whenever you lose life due to damage from the element associated with your Domain, gain absorption equal to the life lost.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Cultivation

When you reach level 6, you are able to carefully shape and remake the land itself to reflect your home domain as you fortify your position.

You gain access to the Cultivate downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, create or remove any number of nearby tile effects of the type associated with your home domain's _shaping_ manifestation. These tile effects persist until the end of your next rest. Each tile effect created or removed in this way must be within a 12 tile range of all other tile effects created during this downtime activity.

## Elemental Mastery

At level 7, you are a master of your element, learning to twist and shape it to bypass your enemies' resistances. Your attacks ignore resistance to the specified elemental damage type and treat immunity to the specified elemental damage type as if it was only resistance.

## Lay of the Locale

At level 10, your connection to the fonts allows you to carefully scout areas

When you use the Commune downtime activity, choose an arena (or other important area) that exists within the font of power. You learn the danger level of that area, as well as:

- the arena's topology
- the arena's general construction
- any objects that exist within that arena
- the details of any vantages that exist within that arena
- any secret connections or hiding places that exist within that arena

You do not learn:

- whether the arena contains any creatures, or any details about them
- the details of the objects in that arena, such as what is depicted on a mural or inside that chest

In addition, once per rest while outside of combat you may immediately gain the benefit of the Commune downtime activity.

## Cascade

At level 11, you can use extra energy that you absorb to fuel the strength of your magic. Whenever you lose life due to taking damage from your element, gain advantage on the next attack you make before the end of your next turn.

## Permaculture

At level 14, you learn to permanently shape the land, planting a seed of your domain in a strange land.

When you use the Cultivate downtime activity, the tile effects created are permanent, although they can be removed with further uses of this downtime activity by a Shaman affiliated with the same Domain. In addition, the tile effects created must be within a 24 tile range of each other, rather than 12.

## Lay of the Font

At level 18, your expert connection with the land allows you to learn the secrets of the fonts as you tap into their energy.

When you use the Commune downtime activity, learn the details of all arenas in the font, as specified in your 10 Lay of the Locale class feature.

In addition, you have advantage on all Focus (Fontcraft) skill checks made to learn more about a font, as specified in your Lay of the Land class feature.

## Wild Magic

At level 20, your magic becomes even more powerful but harder to control. Whenever you spend essence to Surge a manifestation, roll a d4. The Surge level used changes according to the following rules:

- **1:** The Surge level is one less than the essence spent.
- **2:** The Surge level is equal to the essence spent.
- **3:** The Surge level is one more than the essence spent.
- **4:** The Surge level is two more than the essence spent.

Roll to determine the Surge level after you have confirmed that you are using the manifestation but before you select targets.
