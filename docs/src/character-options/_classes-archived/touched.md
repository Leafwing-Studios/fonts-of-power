# Touched

**Source of Power:** Fused with the magic of another soul, the Touched must share a body and mind with an alien entity. Over time, the Host learns to draw on the Companion’s power and share their own, fighting together in a beautiful duet.

**Core Mechanic:** While the Host fights with classical weaponry, the Companion slings simple custom spells in unison. The range of the weapons and spells plays a critical role, and in order to use their power to its fullest the Touched must weave together attacks in both melee and at range each turn.

**Specialization:** Every Companion’s power is unique: granting access to custom spells and trinket affixes that correspond to the elements of its power.

**Approach to Adventure:** As the Touched learns to work together, the Host’s body slowly mutates, becoming more similar to that of their Companion and gaining permanent access to a large number of personalized trinket affixes that reflect their unique capabilities.

**Build Fundamentals:** Touched are natural skirmishers, dancing in and out of the fray of battle. They are most easily built as lightweight highly mobile strikers, but with enough disruption and survivability they can live in the frontline instead:

- Skirmisher: Make sure to have versatile options for both ranged and melee, in both your weapons and powers. The _swapping_, _wild_ and _shifting_ affixes are particularly useful for making this painless. Focus on mobility and avoiding attacks of opportunity with affixes like _deft_ or _shifty_ and try to make sure you end every turn out of the immediate fray.
- Frontline: Draw attention by diving deep into the backline, then stick to your foes with attacks that limit mobility and the proactive combat talent. Back out when you drop low on health, and then heal back up with your Balance of Power: Host feature.

|  1   | I lost control of my magic, and now it has a mind of its own.       |
|  2   | I took in some of the magic of a font of power in order to survive. |
|  3   | I sought it out so I could become stronger.                         |
|  4   | It is an infection or parasite.                                     |
|  5   | It is my familiar, in a sense.                                      |
|  6   | It is another part of who I am.                                     |

| Roll | How do you feel about sharing a body and mind with your companion? |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1   | I despise it and fight against it at every opportunity.            |
|  2   | It makes me doubt who I truly am.                                  |
|  3   | It unnerves me, but I accept its value.                            |
|  4   | I long to lose myself to it, and give up my own identity.          |
|  5   | I want to learn to work together.                                  |
|  6   | I think we'd be better off if we merged and became one.            |

## Companion

Touched are formed by the union between a **Host** and their **Companion.** The interplay between the mundane and the supernatural two gives rise to tremendous capabilities as they learn to work together to exist and fight to survive in a shared body and mind.

By manifesting their true form more strongly, your companion can use **powers:** bursts of magical power that can be used as a major action with no essence cost. Every power targets a single creature and involves an immediate attack roll.

Every companion is associated with two element types, which determine the type of damage that their abilities can do, as well as the type of utility features they gain access to through their Deviance class feature. Select these now, from the twelve standard elements.

Many of the Touched’s features rely on the distinction and interplay between melee and ranged attacks, which are said to belong to the two different **range categories** of the same name. While you are wielding a melee set of arms, the range of your melee powers is the same as the range of those arms. Otherwise, they have a range of 1 tile. While you are wielding a ranged set of arms, the range of your ranged powers is the same as the range of those arms. Otherwise they have a range of 6 tiles.

You learn 3 powers at level 1, built using the rules found in the [Touched Powers](../powers/touched-powers.md) section of the book. You learn an additional power at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. Unlike other classes, the powers available to Touched are built from scratch for each character using a simple set of rules, rather than being selected from a list. See the Powers section at the end of the class description for the rules on doing so.

## Unison

At level 1, you and your companion can strike in unison, combining each of your strengths. Whenever you use the Strike major action, you may spend 1 essence to have your companion simultaneously use a power. You do not need to target the same creature, but the range of this power must be the same (melee or ranged) as your original attack.

## Deviance

Sharing an existence with an otherworldly entity does strange things to the Touched. Starting at level 2, you mutate in strange and powerful ways, becoming more similar to your companion.

When you gain this feature, choose a trinket from the list of trinkets, or work with your table to come up with a fitting non-combat effect of similar power. You gain its effects at all times as if you were attuned to them.

The number of trinket effects that you gain in this way increases by one at levels 6, 10, 14 and 18.

## Balance of Power: Host

Also at level 2, you learn to wrench power away from your companion, healing yourself but weakening it. As a minor action, spend essence equal to your proficiency bonus and gain four times that much life. You have advantage on all basic attacks and disadvantage on all special attacks until the start of your next turn.

## Punctuated Equilibrium

At level 3, you and your companion dance together, moving in short bursts as you attack. After you hit a creature with an attack, you may shift once. This effect only triggers once for each multi-target attack that you hit.

## Balance of Power: Companion

Also at level 3, you learn to carefully share power back to your companion, strengthening it at the cost of your own health. As a minor action, gain essence equal to your proficiency bonus and lose four times that much life. You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and advantage on all special attacks until the start of your turn.

Losing life in this way does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Duet

At level 5, you learn to play your attacks off of those of your companion, attacking both at range and up close in a single fluid movement. When you use your major action to make an attack, you may then combine one of your Balance of Power actions with another attack. Until the end of your turn:

- After you use the Balance of Power: Host feature, if your major action attack was not a power, you may spend 1 essence to make an attack with one of your powers.
- After you use the Balance of Power: Companion feature, if your major action attack was a power, you may spend 1 essence to make a basic attack.
- The attack made as part of this feature cannot be in the same range category as your major action attack.

## Unleash

At level 7, you learn to work in tandem with your companion to unleash your joint fury, leaving yourself completely open in order to obliterate those nearby. You learn to use the Unleash major action at the cost of 3 essence. Make two attacks (in the order of your choice) against every creature within range of your weapon: a basic attack and a power of your choice in the same range class. These attacks are automatically treated as criticals if you hit.

When you use this action, immediately gain a level of exhaustion. Until the start of your next turn:

- you cannot make any other attacks
- you cannot spend movement
- all attacks made against you have advantage

## Lash Out

At level 9, your companion lashes out at those who dare to strike you, and snaps at opportunities to strike. Whenever you use the Block reaction you may spend 1 essence to immediately use a power of your choice against the source of the attack. You may now use your Unison class feature during attacks of opportunity.

## Counterpoint

At level 11, you and your companion move in a deadly dance, exposing your enemies weaknesses for each other. You may now make attacks of opportunity during your turn. Whenever a creature loses life due to one of your attacks, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.

## Symbiosis

At level 13, you and your companion feed on each other’s energy and enthusiasm, bolstering your own strength, The first time each turn that you hit an enemy creature with an attack:

- if it was a special attack, spend 1 essence and restore 4 life
- if it was a basic attack, restore 1 essence

You may now lead with your companion’s power for your Unison class feature.

## Anger Management

At level 15, you learn to carefully work with the fury of your companion, cooling or fanning it for maximum effect. When you use the Unleash major action, you may choose to either halve or double the radius affected.

## Self-Sacrifice

At level 17, you and your companion learn to make deep personal sacrifices for the other to guide their blows.

Whenever you use the Balance of Power: Host feature, you may spend 2 additional essence. If you do, your basic attacks are automatically critical hits if they land until the start of your next turn.

Whenever you use the Balance of Power: Companion feature, you may choose to lose 8 additional life. If you do, your special attacks are automatically critical hits if they land until the start of your next turn.

This feature works differently in concert with the Unleash major action, as these attacks are already automatically critical hits if they land. Instead:

- If you used Balance of Power: Host, make an additional basic attack against all creatures within your weapon’s range.
- If you used Balance of Power: Companion, make an attack with an additional power against all creatures within your weapon’s range. This power selected may be the same or different from the first power used. It must also be in the same range class as your basic attack.

## Perfect Imbalance

When you reach level 20, you have mastered the interplay yourself and your companion, allowing you to change mental and physical state at will.

As a minor action, you may Switch, allowing either host or companion to take full control, or change back into a blended state. When you use your Balance of Power: Host minor action, change to your host form. When you use your Balance of Power: Companion minor action, change to your Companion form.

While in your host form, you:

- are resistant to physical damage
- add half your proficiency bonus to skill checks that you are not proficient in
- ignore all of your deviances

While in your companion form, you:

- are immune to the elemental damage types corresponding to your companion
- gain the benefit of new deviances with a gear point total of 2, selected when you gain this feature

While blended, your critical hits are more powerful, tripling rather than doubling the efficacy of your attacks.
