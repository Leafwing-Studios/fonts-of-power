# Trickster

**Source of Power:** Masters of chance, Tricksters play the odds as they manipulate luck itself to pull off improbable shenanigans with alarming regularity.

**Core Mechanic:** Tricksters take every advantage they can get: slipping into invisibility, tossing out delayed-action explosive tricks and landing low blows as they roll, reroll and amplify their exploding dice.

**Specialization:** Befitting their stylish nature, every Trickster has a particular Flair to their fighting style. This Flair determines the nature of their Low Blows, and gives them access to unique abilities that help them get out of the trouble they seem to invariably get caught up in.

**Approach to Adventure:** Tricksters are the masters of the improbable, and use their skills to their fullest potential. When they Roll the Dice, Tricksters randomly determine an attribute to use with the skill they’ve selected, temporarily gaining proficiency as they carefully persuade locks to open, use their strength to enchant items with a single hammer blow or exploit their knowledge of biomechanics to clear chasms in a single bound,

**Build Fundamentals:** Tricksters can serve as both excellent strikers and controllers, depending on whether they focus on their tricks or basic attacks:

- Striker: Stack Prowess and Agility, focus on critical strikes and try to roll as high as you can. With your easy access to advantage, the _precise_ affix is a staple; try to burst down vulnerable targets from the flanks as you pop out of invisibility.
- Controller: Focus on Expertise and Presence to make sure your endless supply of tricks have the optimal effect. Be mindful of their placement and try to lock down enemies in their effect (or deceive them about its nature): your tricks’ delayed activation and short range really rewards creativity.

## Just Lucky

At level 1, you are able to subtly bend fortune to your whims, helping you land blow after blow with impressive consistency.

Once per round after you make an attack (and see the results), you may spend 1 essence to reroll either the attack made or damage rolled. You must use the new result.

## Winning Streak

At level 1, the damage dealt by your basic attacks explodes. Whenever you roll the maximum possible value on a damage die, reroll that die and add it to the total damage dealt.

This effect can recur indefinitely. If you are rolling multiple dice, you do not need to roll maximum damage on all dice simultaneously. For example, if you hit with a pair of brass knuckles which deal 2d4 damage, and you roll a 2 and a 4, reroll the 4 and add the result to the original 6 damage that would be dealt.

## Trickery

At level 1, Tricksters learn to use tricks, which create strange and useful short-range magical effects.

You may lob or place a selected trick at a location within 3 tiles as a minor action. It detonates at the start of your next turn, typically affecting a 2 tile radius around itself.

Immediately after you use a trick, make a difficulty 10 Presence (Trickery) skill check with advantage. If you fail, your bag of tricks is empty and you cannot use this feature again until you complete a rest.

Tricks are indistinguishable before they detonate. The listed duration of a trick does not begin until it is detonated. If you have two tricks which would detonate at the same time, you may choose which effects resolve first.

If you have at least a minute to prepare, you may choose to hide or disguise your trick, concealing its true nature (and detonation). If you succeed on a difficulty 15 Expertise (Trickery) skill check, its nature is not obvious before it detonates and any effects which are not plainly apparent cannot be traced back to the trick. If you succeed on a difficulty 15 Agility (Trickery) skill check, no one sees you plant the trick. You have disadvantage on these skill checks if there is more than one observer or you are being closely watched.

You learn 3 tricks at level 1 selected from the [Trickster Tricks](../powers/trickster-tricks.md) section of the book. You learn an additional trick at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19.

## Flair

Each Trickster has a particular Flair about them, a particular fashion in which they pull off outrageous and improbable stunts. Choose your Flair at level 1, which grants you unique features as you level up.

### Low Blow

At level 1, the Trickster can strike at exposed weaknesses in a distinctive way, gaining a signature effect every time they land a basic attack made with advantage.

### Bail

At level 7, the Trickster learns to use their Flair to get the ability to get out of sticky situations.

### Ace Up The Sleeve

At level 15, the Trickster gains a special feature that can only be used once per rest in times of desperate need.

## Roll the Dice

When you reach level 2, you can test your luck, attempting to solve problems in entirely unlikely fashions. When you make a skill check, but before you roll, you may choose to instead attempt to change the attribute used for the skill. When you do so, you are temporarily treated as if you are proficient in the skill.

To determine which skill is used, roll a d6:

- **1:** The skill check automatically fails and you cannot use this feature again until you’ve completed a rest.
- **2:** Prowess
- **3:** Agility
- **4:** Expertise
- **5:** Focus
- **6:** Presence

If you roll a 1, describe the unlikely fashion in which you attempted to perform the skill and how it failed. On any other result, describe the fashion in which you used the attribute rolled to perform the action attempted.

## Hit Me

Also at level 2, you revel in the mockery of your opponents as they swing wildly past you. Whenever a basic attack made against you by a hostile creature misses, you may use your reaction and spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus. If you do, restore life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus.

## Vanish

At level 3, you learn to vanish into thin air, becoming invisible for a brief period of time. Whenever you use the Hide minor action, you may become invisible until the start of your next turn. The invisibility breaks immediately after making an attack.

If you choose, you may decide to apply this invisibility to only the parts of your body and objects that you are wearing or carrying of your choice. Doing so prevents you from gaining the invisible status (or any of its benefits), but you have advantage on all Agility (Trickery) skill checks to conceal items if you use this feature to make the item invisible.

## Double or Nothing

When you reach level 3, you gamble with your essence every time you act. Whenever you roll a 1 while making an attack roll or skill check, lose 5 essence. Whenever you roll a 20 while making an attack roll or skill check, gain 5 essence.

This only applies to the final roll used in your attack roll or skill check. If, for example, you were to roll a 3 and a 20 while making a skill check with disadvantage, you would not regain essence from this feature because the final roll would be a 3.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## All In

At level 5, you learn to capitalize on strokes of luck, turning excellent attacks into truly remarkable ones. Once per round when you hit a creature with an attack, you may pay 1 essence after seeing how much damage would be dealt. If you do, double the efficacy of the attack.

At level 9, you may pay 2 essence instead to triple the attack's efficacy.

At level 13, you may pay 3 essence instead to quadruple the attack's efficacy.

At level 17, you may pay 4 essence instead to quintuple the attack's efficacy.

## Fast Talker

At level 6, you can talk your way out of almost anything. Once per rest, after you fail a Presence skill check, you may immediately attempt the same skill check again, ignoring the first outcome.

## Disappear

When you reach level 10, you’ve mastered the art of invisibility. The invisibility granted by your Vanish class feature now lasts until the end of your next turn instead. This allows you to stay invisible by repeatedly using the Hide minor action. This invisibility is still broken immediately after making an attack.

## Dirty Trick

At level 11, you’re able to pull off even more elaborate ploys using your Tricks. As a reaction at the start of any other creature’s turn, you may choose to immediately detonate one of your deployed Tricks.

## Reroll the Dice

At level 14, you have learned to think twice about your unconventional plans, revisiting them if they seem particularly unwise. When you use your Roll the Dice feature, you may reroll the d6 used to select the attribute used. If you do, you must use the new result.

## Push Your Luck

At level 18, you are able to push your luck to achieve feats that seem nearly impossible. After you make a skill check and see the results, you may choose to reroll it. If the result is less than your previous roll you must use the new result. Otherwise, choose whether to reroll again in this fashion or keep this as your final result.

## Reversal of Fortunes

At level 20, you are able to manipulate the luck of yourself and those around you in unbelievable ways. Whenever a creature within 24 tiles of you makes an attack roll (after you see whether or not their attack would hit), you may spend your reaction to force them to reroll their attack roll. They must use the new result.

# Flairs

## Favored One

Whether they were chosen by a god, a supernatural force, or simply due to an elaborate metanarrative joke, Favored One tricksters are inexplicably fortunate in everything they do.

### Low Blow: Spontaneous Malfunction

At level 1, your opponents defenses always seem to fail at the most convenient times. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, apply one stack of defenseless.

### Bail: Improbable Dodge

At level 7, you are able to dodge even effects that lack a physical form or velocity. You may now use the Dodge reaction in response to being hit by any attack. You have disadvantage on all skill checks made to Dodge special attacks other than Grapple or Shove attacks.

### Ace Up The Sleeve: Plot Armor

At level 15, the Chosen One seems nearly impossible to kill, escaping from what seems like certain death by the skin of their teeth. Once per rest, you may cause an attack that would reduce you to 0 life to automatically miss.

Attacks against you have disadvantage while you are at 0 life.

## Magician

Warping the odds through minor magic and sleight of hands, the Magician Tricksters are masters of putting on a show.

### Low Blow: Riveting Performance

At level 1, you learn to distract and disorient your foes, holding their rapt attention with incredible tricks. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, you may choose to apply one stack of taunted.

### Bail: Puff of Smoke

At level 7, you learn to disappear with a puff of smoke, expertly reappearing a short distance away as if by magic. Whenever you use the Hide minor action, you may teleport up to 2 tiles to an empty tile of your choice.

### Ace Up The Sleeve: Card Trick

At level 15, your tricks sometimes seem to change at the last moment, becoming something other than what others could have sworn was put down. Once per rest, when a trick that you have placed is about to detonate, you may gain the effects of any two different tricks that you know instead. You choose the order in which these resolve.

## Ruffian

Charming rapscallions or gruff outlaws, the Ruffian Tricksters are not afraid to get down and dirty to get the job done.

### Low Blow: Called Shot

At level 1, you are able to target specific parts of your foe's body when you strike, crippling their ability to move and fight. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, apply one stack of withered.

### Bail: Duck and Roll

At level 7, you are remarkably adept at using acrobatic maneuver to safely traverse the battlefield. Whenever you use the Dash minor action, you may choose to instead move a distance equal to the amount of movement you would have gained. You may pass through enemy tiles in this way, and attacks of opportunity made against you due to this movement have disadvantage.

### Ace Up The Sleeve: Quick on the Draw

At level 15, you are always prepared for a fight. Once per rest, you may act during a surprise round when you otherwise would not be able to. This feature works even if there would not otherwise be a surprise round.
