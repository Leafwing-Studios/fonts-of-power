# Powers

In _Fonts of Power,_ every character class and monster gains access to special actions that they can take, expressing their magical energy in unique ways. Most classes gain access to new variants of these powers every time they receive an attribute increase (at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19). If an effect refers to “learning additional powers from your class”, learn additional variants of this sort, as shown in the right-hand column of your class.

In addition to the core actions that you should have available on a standard reference sheet, it is strongly recommended to make a list of all of the new actions you learn, along with their cost and effect, sorted by which type of action is required to make them. Try to minimize the amount of time you spend referring back to the original source material. This helps make sure you remember your options, and goes a long way to making sure combat runs smoothly.

Using powers only takes essence and the ability to act. You do not have to utter magic words, make elaborate gestures with a free hand or hunt down exotic ingredients in order to use the powers you have acquired. If a player wants to do so to make their use of the powers more fun and immersive, such as a Devout uttering a specific plea every time they make use of their Prayer feature, they’re free to do so. But there’s no requirement for that, and that Devout losing their ability to speak would not stop them from being able to use their Prayer feature.

Powers are typically quite showy, and noticeable to those around you. You must make an appropriate skill check (typically Arcana, Charm, Stealth or Trickery) to hide their use, if the table rules that doing so is feasible in this instance. Creatures who detect the use of powers with their Focus (Perception) skill tend to know who was responsible, and may make a further Expertise (Arcana) check to attempt to learn more about the details of the power used.
