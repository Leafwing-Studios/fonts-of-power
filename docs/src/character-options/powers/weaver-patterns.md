You wrap the Weave around an object or set of arms within range that is not being held or worn, allowing you to manipulate it at a distance. You may use the Interact and Activate minor action in this way, manipulating objects at range by using this pattern.

If you animated a set of arms:

- You may only animate the set of arms you currently have equipped.
- When you use your Thread Twisting minor action (gained at level 3), you gain the benefit of the Swap minor action, and may equip arms up to 6 tiles away from you.
- The arms get their own token.
- The arms share your defenses and any other effects that are active on you, other than ailments or statuses. They cannot take damage, gain absorption or gain afflictions or any other status. They can gain their own ailments, which clear independently.
- The arms are flying.
- At the end of each of your turns for the duration of this effect, you may move the object up to 6 tiles. This is not increased if you have multiple copies of this pattern active.
- After you move the object, you may make a basic attack using these arms. If you have multiple copies of this pattern active, you may make one basic attack per copy of this pattern.

**Range:** Ranged, 6 tiles

**Targets:** Single-target

**Targeted defense:** Prowess

**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn

</div>

You warp the Weave into a solid bubble of force, large enough to contain a creature or object that fits within a single tile. This bubble is transparent, nearly weightless, grants full cover and blocks all sound and effects (including any attacks) from passing through it. You cannot target this creature or sustain other patterns on this creature (unless you are the creature in the bubble). Similar lingering effects such as the Soulbinder’s Pulses cease to function.

Effects which apply forced movement other than by teleportation (such as the Shove minor action) automatically hit this bubble and the effects of force movement are doubled. Creatures in this bubble are immune to falling damage.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration of the effect, make a special attack against Prowess against the creature within the bubble. If you miss, they break free as they burst through the bubble. Other creatures may spend a minor action to attempt to break the bubble, succeeding if they win a skill contest pitting their Prowess (Athletics) against your Presence (Arcana).

While within the bubble, a creature may attempt to roll the bubble, spending twice as much movement as usual to move. The first time each turn that they try to do so, they must make a difficulty 10 Agility (Acrobatics) skill check. If they fail, they fall prone. The bubble naturally rolls down slopes if not held in place, moving 3 tiles (6 tiles if it is a particularly steep slope) at the start of the trapped creature’s turn down the slope. You cannot move up stairs or the like while in this bubble.

## Pattern of Dampening

You wrap the Weave around your target, buffering it from the world like a thick ball of cotton. Select a creature or object within range. At the end of each of your turns for the duration of this effect, make a special attack against Focus against them. If you hit, the efficacy of all attacks made and boons applied by and against this creature are halved until the end of your next turn.

This effect does not stack with itself, and applies to boons applied to oneself (such as absorption gained through the _absorptive_ armor affix). When this pattern is sustained, the efficacy changes persist until after the new Focus attack is made.

When you use your Thread Twisting minor action, you may freely reposition this rift within range.

Creatures can use the Scan minor action to attempt to examine the effect, realizing the truth of the illusion with a successful Focus (Insight) check contested by your Expertise (Arcana). If they fail, they remain convinced that it is real, and devise alternative explanations for any oddities. Each time they learn a new piece of contradictory information, they may attempt a new contested skill check. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature and they have advantage on all skill checks made to detect further illusions from you until you complete a rest.

If you hit, teleport them to an empty square of your choice within 3 tiles of you that is outside the 1 tile bubble. Unlike many similar effects, creatures can be affected by this bubble multiple times in a single turn if they keep re-entering the bubble.

If you are affected by multiple copies of this effect at once, the radius increases by 1 tile and the distance you can teleport them increases by 3 tiles for each copy.
