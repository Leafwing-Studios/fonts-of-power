# Trickster Tricks

## Bamboozle

<div class="tight">

**Action:** Minor action

**Cost:** 0 essence

**Range:** Melee, 3 tiles

**Targets:** Multi-target

**Targeted defense:** Presence

**Duration:** 1 minute

</div>

A strange thought takes root in the mind of those near your trick. When detonated, make a special attack against Presence against all creatures within 2 tiles of the trick. You have disadvantage on this attack if you are in combat. If you hit, for the duration of this effect they are unshakably convinced that a single fact is true.

Whenever the creature is presented with solid evidence that this fact is false, they may make a Focus (Insight) check opposed by your Expertise (Arcana) skill check to end the effect and recognize the truth. They have advantage on this skill check if they are in combat, and may make a new skill check whenever they are hit by an attack. This effect cannot modify or remove existing memories, but instead convinces the target to seek some alternate explanation for any discordant facts that they may know.

At the end of the duration of this effect, or if you miss with your attack, they recognize the thoughts as irrational (although they may not be able to determine their origin). Once you have missed with this trick or it has expired, they cannot be convinced that the same tale is true by this trick.

## Convenient Fiction

<div class="tight">

**Action:** Minor action

**Cost:** 0 essence

**Range:** Melee, 3 tiles

**Targets:** Multi-target

**Targeted defense:** None

**Duration:** Instant

</div>

As your trick detonates, the air shimmers before it seems to snap back into place as a brand new scene takes its place. When detonated, a 2 tile radius around the trick becomes filled with an illusory scene of your choice for the duration of this trick, filled with the sights, sounds and smells of your choice.

Creatures observing this scene can use the Scan minor action to examine the hallucination, making a Focus (Insight) check contested by your Expertise (Arcana) skill. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the scene is an illusion, and it becomes translucent to them. The first time any creature observes this illusion, they make a contested skill check of this sort automatically. Creatures who are told that this scene is an illusion automatically succeed on these skill checks.

While convinced, creatures treat the hallucination as if it were real. Anything unusual or illogical that occurs is rationalized away, although they may make a new contested skill check as a result of the new information.

Creatures cannot take damage from this effect.

## Double Trouble

<div class="tight">

**Action:** Minor action

**Cost:** 0 essence

**Range:** Melee, 3 tiles

**Targets:** Multi-target

**Targeted defense:** None

**Duration:** 10 minutes

The trick explodes in a flash of light as suddenly two copies of each creature appear, leaving everyone uncertain about which one is real. When detonated:
Make an illusory copy of each creature within 2 tiles of the trick, which appears in empty tile(s) adjacent to the creature that they’re copying.

Illusory copies act according to the wishes of the creature they are copying on their turns, and are capable of all of the same actions.

Roll a d20 the first time that an affected creature or its illusory double:

- succeeds on a skill check
- lands an attack (after damage was rolled and the choice to use the Block or Dodge reaction was made)
- is hit by an attack
- takes damage

On a result of 11 or higher, the illusory copy was targeted or made the attack, and the attack or skill has no effect. Regardless of the results of this roll, the illusion disappears, leaving only the real creature behind. As a party, you may spend a Resolve to modify the outcome of this d20.

At the end of this effect, if the illusion has not yet been revealed, the affected creature may choose which copy was real all along, and the other illusory copy disappears.
