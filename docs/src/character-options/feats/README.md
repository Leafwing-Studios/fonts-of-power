# Feats

Feats capture the unique talents, training and specializations of your character: offering compelling mechanical twists and telling a story about who they are as an individual.

You gain one combat feat and one exploration feat at level 1, and then gain an additional feat of your choice (from either category) at levels 3, 6 and 9.

Some feats are class or species-specific, allowing you to customize and build upon the features and flavor of your class and species.
When you select a feat, you must meet all of the prerequisites listed.
If you ever lose these prerequisites (such as by changing out the skills you know, or being resurrected as a new species), you must immediately reselect the affected feats.
