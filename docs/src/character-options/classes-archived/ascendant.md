# Ascendant

**Source of Power:** Driven by relentless self-improvement, Ascendants hone their body into the perfect weapon, powered purely by their force of will and intense training (or strange experiments).

**Core Mechanic:** Ascendants chain their attacks together using their Combination Strikes feature, gaining the ability to make a new Strike, Grapple or Shove attack after landing their last one. In the face of danger, Ascendants calmly meditate, healing and dodging attacks as they take the Defend major action.

**Specialization:** Every Ascendant’s body adapts in a unique fashion, giving them access to a remarkable number of affixes of their choice via the Natural Offense, Natural Defense and Self-Improvement class features to support truly unique build choices.

**Approach to Adventure:** Carefully reflecting, Ascendants gain access to the powerful Meditate downtime activity, which allows them to earn a Resolve for their party with a Focus (Insight) skill check. At higher levels, ascendants use their adapted body to the fullest, mastering Athletics, Perception and eventually even death itself.

**Build Fundamentals:** Ascendants naturally fill the control and striker roles:

- Striker: keep yourself safe through superior mobility with affixes like ineffable or flying, and then build to empower your basic attacks to deal damage with a flurry of blows.
- Controller: apply ailments with your basic attacks using the imbued strikes affix, or focus on grappling. prioritizing the grasping appendages affix to make sure you can lock down more than one creature at once.

# Self-Improvement

Each Ascendant customizes their body in unique ways, turning their body into a natural weapon. Your body changes mutating, transforming or granting you superhuman abilities to allow you to perform feats such as grabbing your opponents with your beastly jaws, striking at them with a long scorpion tail, shooting spikes at them out of your hands or tripping enemies with incredible speed.

At level 1, create a set of arms using the standard rules with a gear point total of 3. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may also choose to create a set of armor with a gear point total of 3 in this way. If you do, you are always attuned to it and always have it equipped, but cannot equip or attune to any other set of armor.

You cannot modify these arms or armor with the Craft or Enchant downtime activities, but whenever you level up, you may freely replace the affixes of these arms and armor, obeying any usual restrictions.

## Combination Strikes

In battle, the Ascendant is an unstoppable martial force, striking their enemy with a flurry of chained blows from the improved body they have created. At level 1, whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you may spend one essence to immediately make another Strike, Grapple or Shove attack against them.

At level 1, you may only use this feature once per round, resetting at the start of each of your turns. The number of times per round that you can use this feature increases by one at levels 5, 9, 13 and 17.

While you cannot usually spend essence while making attacks of opportunity, you can spend essence on Combination Strikes to follow up on attacks of opportunity that you land.

## Inner Strength

At level 1, you learn to augment your body with powerful temporary magical abilities. Whenever you make an attack, make a difficulty 10 Presence (Anima) skill check. If you succeed, that attack gainst the benefit of one of the affixes that you know. If you fail, you may choose to either cancel the attack, wasting your action, or complete the attack (optionally choosing new targets) without the affix.

You learn 3 affixes at level 1 selected from the [list of affixes](https://tools.fontsofpower.com). You learn an additional affix at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. These must be arms affixes, cannot be prismatic and must have a gear point cost of 1 or less.

## Meditation

When you reach level 2, you learn to sit in perfect tranquility, refreshing yourself even as battle rages around you. Whenever you take the Defend major action and have not yet spent movement or made an attack this turn, you may spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to regain life equal to four times the essence spent. When you do, you cannot spend movement or make any attacks until the start of your next turn.

You also gain access to the Meditate downtime activity, seeking to learn an inner truth. Make a difficulty 15 Focus (Insight) skill check. If you succeed, the party gains a Resolve.

## Inner Mastery

At level 3, you learn to translate your inner strength into external precision. After you make a Presence (Anima) skill check with your Inner Strength class feature you may choose to use that skill check result as the attack roll result for the triggering attack.

You must choose whether or not to use this feature before you make an attack roll, and do not make an attack roll if you use this feature. Use the d20 result from the skill check result to determine whether or not the attack is a critical hit.

## Tranquility

When you reach level 3, maintaining your tranquility in the face of danger only bolsters your spirit. Whenever you take the Defend major action, until the start of your next turn, regain 1 essence each time that a hostile creature misses you with an attack.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Discipline

When you reach level 6, the results of your intense physical training (or strange improvements) are clearly visible. You have advantage on all Athletics skill checks that you make.

## Blur

At level 7, you fight with incredible speed, blurring your form and causing attacks to slide off of you. Each time you use your Combination Strikes feature, gain 1 absorption.

## Sublimation

Upon reaching level 10, you have transcended bodily needs. You no longer need to eat, drink or breathe and you recover from two levels of exhaustion every time you complete a rest.

## Inner Duality

At level 11, you learn to combine the magical manifestations of your will. Whenever the Presence (Anima) skill check result made as part of your Inner Strength class feature is at least 15, you may gain the benefit of two of your affixes instead of just one.

## Awareness

When you reach level 14, you are always alert and aware of your surroundings. You no longer need to sleep, but must still spend the same amount of time in quiet contemplation to gain the benefits of a rest. While contemplating you remain alert and can still make Perception skill checks like usual. You have advantage on all Perception skill checks that you make.

## Purity

At level 15, your body forcibly rejects harmful influences as incongruent with your greater plan. At the end of each of your turns, remove an additional stack of each ailment.

## Reincarnation

As a level 18 Ascendent, you never truly die, your soul entering back into the circle of life. While dead, you do not gain stacks of Transcendence. Others have advantage on all skill checks made to resurrect you.

## Ascension

When you reach level 20, you have achieved your ideal form: body and mind existing in perfect harmony. Whenever you successfully use the Meditate downtime activity, choose one of the following effects:

- There is no limit to the number of times that you may use your Combination Strikes feature per round but you may no longer take the Defend major action.
- At the start of each of your turns, remove one stack of each affliction and ailment from yourself. When you use the Defend major action and take advantage of your Meditation class feature, gain 12 absorption.
- Your movement speed is doubled, attacks of opportunity against you have disadvantage and you may pass through enemy tiles.
- You have advantage on all special attacks. You may make Shove attacks using your Combination Strikes feature without spending any extra essence or counting against the total number of attacks used, although your chain still breaks if you miss them.
- You have advantage on Presence (Anima) skill checks made for your Inner Strength class feature.

The chosen effect persists until it is replaced by another in this list.
