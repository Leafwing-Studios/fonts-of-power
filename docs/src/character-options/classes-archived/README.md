# Classes

Every player character has a class: the source of their magical powers. As you level up, you will learn to master this power, gaining new class features and expanding your repertoire of powers. _The Player’s Guide to Fonts of Power_ contains 12 classes, each with their own source of magic and unique playstyle. You can click the header names to go directly to the full description of that class.

**Classifying Playstyles**

By categorizing the patterns in which various classes (and characters) play in combat, we can describe their **playstyle** in a way that helps us think and communicate about how they work across several important axes. This classification is intended to act as a guide, not a prescription, helping you make quick and informed decisions during character building.

The **approach** of a character describes the tools they use in combat:

- **Martial:** Uses traditional weaponry almost exclusively.

- **Caster:** Uses magical spells almost exclusively.

- **Spellblade:** Combines traditional weaponry and magic spells.

The **position** of a character reflects where they prefer to fight from, relative to the fray:

- **Frontline:** Take and land hits in melee.

- **Backline:** Sling attacks from a safe distance.

- **Skirmisher:** Highly mobile, moving in and out between different ranges as needed.

The **role** of a character captures the methods that they use to help their party prevail:

- **Striker:** Ensure that your opponents’ life hits 0 before your party’s does.

- **Controller:** Limit your opponents’ actions by shaping the battlefield or impairing their effectiveness.

- **Guardian:** Support your allies by protecting and enhancing them.

When a playstyle is listed in _italics_, opting into that classification will require more specific character choices.
