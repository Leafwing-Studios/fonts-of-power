# Devout

**Source of Power:** Praying to a higher power, the Devout are offered a taste of unimaginable power, capable of working miracles so long as they please their sometimes unreliable god.

**Core Mechanic:** The Devout’s miracles are incredibly powerful, persisting as long as their concentration holds, but pulling them off is no meager feat. Each turn that the Devout uses a prayer, their favor grows. This favor amplifies the effect of their bribes of essence, beginning a powerful miracle as they suddenly become the most important objective on the battlefield.

**Specialization:** Each Devout worships a particular deity, distinguished both by its three elemental domains and the nature of its power, which determines the consequences of the Devout attempting and failing to invoke a miracle.

**Approach to Adventure:** With diligent work, rituals offer the power of a miracle on demand, opening the door to creative problem solving through incredible power. By reading the vague signs left by their god, Devout are also capable of limited insight into the future with their Augury subclass feature,

**Build Fundamentals:** Depending on your selection of prayers, Devouts can serve as effective strikers, controllers or guardians:

- Striker: Bide your time and set up for a huge wrath miracle that devastates the entire battlefield. By selecting the _avatar_ cycle of prayers and prioritizing Prowess and Agility, you can become a powerful martial force to be reckoned with, putting an entirely different twist on the class.
- Controller: Neutralize your foes with the curse cycle of prayers or shape the battlefield with the genesis cycle, completely swinging the whole tide of battlefield when your miracles come through. With the party’s help, you can play a slow, defensive style and pull off an impossibly powerful _portent_ miracle, creating stories that will never be forgotten.
- Guardian: Looks for prayers that grant boons to your allies, such as the _blessing_ and _gift_ cycles, then supercharge an ally with a miracle while you stay safe in the backline.

## Prayer

The Devout gains access to incredible power by praying to higher beings, who may or may not decide to grant the request. Devout channel the magic of their gods through the **Pray** major action, which does not cost essence.

You learn 3 prayers at level 1 selected from the [Devout Prayers](../powers/devout-prayers.md) section of the book. You learn an additional prayer at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. When you learn prayers, they must be associated with one of the three elements that make up the Domains of your Devotion.

## Miracles

Devout may call upon their deity to turn their prayers into a powerful sustained miracle, subject to the whims of their god.

If you have not yet spent movement this turn, you may use the **Invoke** major action. When you do so:

1. Select a prayer.
2. Make a **Favor check:**
   1. If you succeed, gain the benefits of the Miracle form of the chosen prayer, and reset your Favor to 0.
   2. If you fail, suffer Consequences, as outlined by your Devotion, and reduce your Favor by 1.
3. You cannot spend movement until the start of your next turn.

You cannot use the Invoke major action while another miracle is in effect.

Devout track the shifting Favor of their deities at all times, which influences the odds of working miracles. While in combat, your Favor changes in the following ways:

- **Increase by 1:** the first time during your turn in combat that you cast a prayer.
- **Decrease by 1:** whenever you fail a Favor check.
- **Reset to 0:** whenever you pass a Favor check.

You do not gain Favor when you cast a prayer as a result of the Invoke major action.

To make a Favor check to see if your miracle succeeds, you roll some number of d20s based on your current Favor:

- **Favor < 0:** roll X + 1 d20s, where X is the absolute value of your Favor, and use the lowest result
- **Favor = 0:** roll 1 d20 and use that result
- **Favor > 0:** roll Y + 1 d20s, where Y your Favor, and use the highest result.

You only succeed on your Favor check if the result of your Favor check is 20 or higher. As a party, you may choose to spend Resolve to modify the result of a Favor check.

All miracles have a duration of Concentration and continue to take effect until you lose your concentration, as described in the Concentration section of the Combat chapter. If the miracle has the Persisting descriptor in its duration, the effect is permanent if you have maintained your concentration on it for one minute (10 rounds). Miracles which have persisted do not end in any of the usual fashions.

All miracles (other than those which have persisted) end whenever you complete a rest, or when you choose to end them at the end of one of your turns. Miracles also end if you and the target of your effect are separated by more than five times the miracle’s range; line of sight is only required for the initial cast. If there are several targets (such as for the Blessing cycle of miracles), it only ends on the targets that are out of range.

## Offering

As a level 1 Devout, you know how to tip the scales of judgement by leaning on them with your own power. Whenever you make a Favor check, you may spend any amount of essence up to four times your proficiency bonus. Add that much to the results of your Favor check.

## Devotion

Each Devout is devoted to a particular divine, infernal or otherwise unknowable and powerful cosmic being. Each Devotion is associated with three domains, areas of its divine focus and intervention, which determine the prayers available to the Devout.

You gain access to unique Devotion-specific features at level 1, and gain more as you grow in power.

### Consequences

At level 1, the Devout learns the consequences of displeasing the divine, and the results of a failure on an attempt to Pray is revealed.

### Augury

At level 6, you gain access to the Augury downtime activity, and may attempt to read the vague portents and omens of your deity. In order to use this feature, you must present a yes or no question. Your worldspeaker rolls a d20, and then answers your question based on the result.

You are not guaranteed to get accurate information about which path is superior; the nature of your Devotion determines the exact mechanism of this. If the worldspeaker genuinely doesn’t know the answer to your question, they can say “I don’t know”, and you may immediately ask a different question in its place.

If you ask a repeat question, you god becomes upset at your petulant nagging and smites you down, immediately reducing you to 0 life and 0 essence.

## Ritual

When you reach level 2, you learn to perform intricate rituals to win your deity’s blessing. You gain access to the Ritual downtime activity. When you complete this downtime activity, choose one:

- gain the benefit of the Miracle version of a prayer that you know as if you'd used the Invoke major action and passed your Favor check
- your Favor increases by 1

## Benediction

Also at level 2, you learn the following prayer, imploring your deity to heal your wounds.

### Benediction

**Cost:** 0
**Casting time:** Major action
**Range:** Self
**Duration:** Instant

Imploring your deity for mercy, you beg for their protection. Gain 3 + ½ Presence absorption and the benefits of the Defend major action.

### Benediction - Miracle

**Cost:** 0
**Casting time:** Full round
**Range:** Self
**Duration:** Concentration

You are bathed in an otherworldly light as the blessing of your deity mends your wounds. At the start of each of your turns for the duration of this effect, gain the benefits of the Defend major action and spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to gain life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus.

## Rebuke

At level 3, you may chastise those who would dare interrupt you during your sacred duties, forcing them to their knees in repentance. You gain access to the Rebuke power. As a reaction whenever a creature enters your zone of control, you may make a special attack against Focus against them. If you hit, knock them prone, applying one stack of rooted and one stack of pacified.

## Respite

Also at level 3, sometimes your god takes mercy on you in your most desperate hour. Whenever you succeed on a Favor check made while your Favor is less than zero, refund any essence spent with your Offering class feature for that Favor check.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Good Deeds

At level 5, your good deeds do not go unnoticed. Whenever you use the Treat minor action on another creature, also gain its benefit targeting yourself using the same skill check result.

## As a Lamb Among Wolves

When you reach level 7, your god bolsters you in the face of danger, rewarding your courage. At the start of each of your turns, gain 2 absorption for each enemy zone of control that you are in. If you are in the zone of control of an enemy creature that takes multiple turns per round, gain 2 absorption for each turn per round that it takes.

## Steadfast

At level 9, you are able to shrug off the most serious of interruptions by your faith in your deity. You gain advantage on all Endurance skill checks made to maintain your concentration.

## Hurried Ritual

At level 10, you are able to perform rituals much more quickly with the aid of assistants. Once per rest, you may gain the benefit of the Ritual downtime activity after spending only 10 minutes in careful, dedicated ceremony.

## Desperate Plea

At level 11, your deity occasionally grants you its blessing in your time of need, even if you have been judged unworthy. Once per rest, you may treat a failure on a Favor check as if it were a success.

## Combined Miracle

When you reach level 13, you are able to work two miracles at once, combining their effects in a spectacular fashion. Whenever you use the Invoke major action, you may attempt to gain the benefit of two different miracles at the same time, selecting both prayers when you use the Invoke major action.

If your Favor check is 25 or higher, gain the benefits of both miracles. Otherwise, suffer the Consequences of both miracles.

Like always, your concentration on these prayers is shared; they always end at the same time and you roll only once when you lose life.
You still only gain the benefit of a single Miracle when you use your Ritual downtime activity.

## Evangelism

At level 14, your converts follow their newfound religion with a remarkable zeal. When you successfully convince someone via a deal to join the religion you are devoted to, they are unusually committed to the cause, and ignore any negative modifier from self-interest while evaluating future deals with you. Furthermore, unless you are directly contradicted by a higher-ranking member of the same religion, they take your word as authoritative when it comes to the doctrine of the religion and the will of your deity.

## Chastise

At level 15, you are able to hold back whole crowds with your admonishments. Whenever you hit a creature with your Rebuke reaction, refresh your reaction.

## Inscrutable

At level 17, you learn to deflect any attempt to interfere with your miracles. Whenever you use the Invoke major action, you also gain the benefit of the Defend major action.

## Privileged Information

At level 18, you finally learn to communicate directly with your deity and may occasionally ask them questions. Once per rest when you use the Scan minor action, you may immediately gain the benefit of the Augury downtime activity specific to your subclass.

## Favored

When you reach level 20, you are a particular favorite of your deity, easily winning their approval. The first time during your turn in combat that you cast a prayer, your Favor increases by 2 rather than 1. In addition, the Ritual downtime activity now increases your Favor by 2 rather than 1 when you choose to increase your Favor.

# Devotion

## Divine

Aligning themselves with a deity whose cause they believe in, the Devoted of the Divine seek to spread the word and carry out the doctrine of the god.

### Consequences: Divine Displeasure

At level 1, when the Devout of a Divine entity fails a Favor check, your deity is deeply disappointed in you. You instead immediately cast the standard version of the prayer you selected.

### Augury: Vague Portents

At level 6, you gain access to the Vague Portents downtime activity.
Present a yes or no question.
Your worldspeaker rolls a d20, and then answers your question based on the result.
If the result is 10 or less, you cannot discern any useful information. If the result is 11 or higher, you learn the true answer.

## Malevolent

Seeking power at any cost, those devoted to Malevolent entities are both respectful and wary of their gods.

### Consequences: Power at a Price

At level 1, when the Devout of a Malevolent deity fails a Favor check, they are granted the power they seek but at a great cost. You cast the Miracle version of the prayer you selected, but a hostile or adversarial creature of the worldspeaker’s choice within 12 tiles also gains the benefit of an identical prayer as well.

Like usual, they must maintain their concentration. If there is no appropriate adversary within range, nothing happens.

### Augury: Malicious Advice

At level 6, you gain access to the Malicious Advice downtime activity.
Present a yes or no question.
Your worldspeaker rolls a d20 in secret, and then answers your question based on the result.
If the result is 5 or less, you are told the wrong answer. If the result is 6 or higher, you learn the true answer.

## Primeval

Connected with the ancient powers that form the world.

### Consequences: Direct Line

At level 1, when the Devout of a Primeval deity fails a Favor check, the miracle occurs but you are overloaded with incredible, uncontrolled magical energy. You cast the miracle version of the prayer you selected, but must make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check to mitigate the damage done by the uncontrolled energy flowing through your body. Gain 5 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

### Augury: Ancient Offering

At level 6, you gain access to the Ancient Offering downtime activity.
Present a yes or no question.
Your worldspeaker rolls a d20, and then answers your question based on the result.
You may sacrifice any number of essence crystals as part of this downtime activity. The worldspeaker adds five times the number of essence crystals sacrificed to the roll made.
If the final result is 15 or lower, you do not receive an answer, unable to form a connection with your deity. If the result is 16 or higher, you learn the true answer.
