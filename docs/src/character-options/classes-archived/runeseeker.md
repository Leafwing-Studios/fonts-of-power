# Runeseeker

**Source of Power:** Drawing on ancient knowledge, Runeseekers perfectly capture the essence of a phenomenon in a rune that they draw in the air. Each rune requires intense study and careful practice, but once mastered can be subtly altered in numerous ways to determine the final effect.

**Core Mechanic:** Runeseekers are the quintessential, straightforward spellcasters. Their major action will almost always be spent to cast a powerful spell, but with the use of various Runic Alteration features they are able to modify these spells to adapt to the situation at hand.

**Specialization:** Each runeseeker belongs to a School of Magic: the literal school in which they were taught. This choice shapes which of the four knowledge skills (Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering) they specialize in, as well as the bulk of their spell lists. Runeseekers further specialize through the personalized selection of runic alterations, allowing them to modify the spells they know to support a unique strategy.

**Approach to Adventure:** Runeseekers take a hands on approach to learning, seeking knowledge, adventure and treasure as they delve deep into the fonts of knowledge. Their Secrets of the Past class feature is surprisingly useful for research and puzzle solving while their Rune Seeking (and later Lore Seeking) give them supernatural access to information that rewards careful preparation.

**Build Fundamentals:** Runeseekers make excellent strikers or powerful controllers, depending on their selection of spells and arms affixes:

- _Striker:_ Select spells that deal tons of damage, aiming for a diversity of effects and elemental damage types. Afflictions don't do damage immediately, but can be particularly effective in longer fights. _Effective thaumaturgy_ and _cruel thaumaturgy_ are excellent ways to increase the damage of your spells, or pick up _keen_ and _effervescent triumph_ to specialize in critical strikes.
- _Controller:_ Focus on spells that apply forced movement and ailments, prioritizing tools that synergize with your allies plans. _Imbued thaumaturgy_, _cantrip_ and _imbued conversion_ are great ways to get access to new ailments, while affixes with the "vantage" tag (like _fogcaller_) can help you shape the battlefield. _Distant thaumaturgy_ can be a great choice for staying safe in the backline, while _expansive thaumaturgy_ can help make sure you hit all of the important targets at once.

## Runecasting

Runeseekers draw on the magic of knowledge, perfectly capturing the essence of a phenomenon as they trace the corresponding sigil in the air.

As a level 1 Runeseeker, you have access to the Cast major action, allowing you to cast diverse spells to blast away your foes or control the battlefield.

In their most basic form, Runeseeker spells always cost 1 essence, use a major action and make an attack against a single creature.
When you cast a spell, you may spend additional essence to empower its effects, up the maximum total essence shown in the table below.

| Level | Max Essence per Spell |
| :---: | :-------------------: |
|  1-4  |           1           |
|  5-8  |           2           |
| 9-12  |           3           |
| 13-16 |           4           |
| 17-20 |           5           |

You learn 4 spells at level 1 selected from the [Runeseeker Spells](../powers/runeseeker-spells.md) section of the book. You learn an additional spell at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. At least half of the spells that you know must be from the spell list associated with your school of magic (described immediately below); other spells can be chosen freely from other schools of magic.

## School of Magic

At level 1, each Runeseeker chooses a **school of magic**, specializing in a particular form of magic according to their unique training. This choice determines the primary spell list available to you, as well as the benefits of your level 15 Runic Alteration: Style and level 20 Pinnacle of Knowledge class feature.

Each school is associated with a particular **academic skill**. You are proficient in this skill (in addition to the five skill you select), and several of your features grant additional uses or bonuses to the academic skill associated with your choice of school.

## Elaborate Runes

While the runeseeker's spells are exceptionally powerful, they are more complicated to cast during combat than those of other classes. At level 1, choose one of the following drawbacks for your spells. Like with all choices made as part of character creation (such as which spell you selected, the option chosen for one of your Runic Alteration class features or your attribute spread), you may change up to two of these choices each time you level up.

### Hurried Casting

Your spells are quick but inefficient. You have disadvantage on skill checks made to use the Essence Tap minor action. Your Essence Tap minor action now only restores essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus, rather than three times your proficiency bonus like usual.

### Risky Casting

Your spells are powerful but leave you open to counterattack as you pour all of your attention into drawing the required rune. Whenever you cast a spell, provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like all attacks of opportunity, this attack of opportunity resolves before the triggering action (casting a spell in this case) is complete.

### Focused Casting

Your spells are perfectly executed but require your careful concentration to complete. The effects of this power do not trigger until the start of your next turn (although you must spend essence upfront). You must maintain [concentration](../rules/combat/tactical-mechanics?id=concentration) for this duration, or the power fails. Choose the target(s) of the spell at that time, along with any alterations.

Casting a spell in this way counts as making an attack for the purpose of the crazed ailment. For all other purposes, the attack is only made at the time of the spell's completion.

## Secrets of the Past

At level 2, your studies give you a distinct edge when attempting to research, recall or discover facts about the past. You have advantage on skill checks that use Insight or your academic skill made to learn information about events that occurred in the past.

## Self-Reliance

Also at level 2, you are able to convert some of the essence that you draw upon into magical healing, allowing you to press on in pursuit of treasure and knowledge. After you use the Essence Tap minor action (but not after you automatically trigger it due to running out of essence), you may spend essence up to twice your proficiency bonus to restore life equal to four times the essence spent.

## Runic Alteration: Quantifier

At level 3, you unlock the first of many advanced techniques; combining the inscribed rune with a quantifier to allow it to affect many creatures at once. Learn one of the following three **alterations**. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to apply any number of alterations that you know.

### Spherical Alteration

The altered spell becomes multi-target, hitting all creatures within a 2 tile radius around a tile selected within range. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

### Conical Alteration

The altered spell becomes multi-target, hitting all creatures within a 3 tile cone behind a tile selected within range. This cone always points directly away from the caster. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

### Spreading Alteration

When this alteration is applied, the spell becomes multi-target, jumping from creature to creature. At each jump, select the closest creature (within 2 tiles) of the previous one. This chain can contain up to three targets total. Creatures can only be part of each chain once; you cannot return to them. In the event of a tie, the caster may choose which creatures to affect. Halve the efficacy of spells altered in this way.

## Rune Seeking

**Questions for the Runeseek downtime activity**

1. What dangers about this entity have I not noticed?

</div>

At level 6, you have begun to learn the art of runeseeking, granting you the ability to carefully scry for rare and powerful treasure, uncovering their secrets. Gain access to the **Runeseek** downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, make a Focus skill check using your academic skill.

You can **uncover** treasure (magical items) in this way. When you do, the worldspeaker provides the name, short description and complete list of affixes for each uncovered treasure.

Choose a nearby font of power, then choose one of the following options:

- **Breadth:** Uncover one new treasure found in that font of power at random for every five points of your skill check result.
- **Depth:** Choose one treasure that you have previously uncovered, or one treasure that you currently possess. For every ten points of your skill check result, you may learn the answer to one question of your choice about that treasure.

## Runic Alteration: Style

At level 7, you master your fourth and final technique; adding a unique twist to the runes that you inscribe that embodies the essential nature of your school of magic. Learn one of the three alterations described in the section for your school of magic, found at the end of this class description. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to apply any number of alterations that you know.

## Field Notes

At level 10, you learn to take full advantage of the unique academic opportunities provided by subjecting yourself to intense and unusual danger. Whenever you gain a Resolve, also gain the benefit of the Prepare downtime activity, focusing on the academic skill associated with your school of magic.

## Runic Alteration: Accent

At level 11, you master your third technique; adding an accent to the inscribed rune that causes it to be more effective in some circumstances, but less in others.
Learn one of the following three alterations. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to apply any number of alterations that you know.

### Point-blank Alteration

The altered spell becomes melee, with a range equal to your zone of control. As a result, you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with this spell while in an enemy zone of control. When used in concert with an alteration from your Runic Alteration: Quantifier class feature, the area of effect is centered around you, rather than a tile of your choice within range (although you may choose the direction of any relevant effects), although it does not affect you.

### Swelling Alteration

You have disadvantage on attacks made with the altered spell against targets within half of the range of the spell, and advantage on all other attacks made with the altered spell.

### Reckless Alteration

You have disadvantage on attacks made with the altered spell, but your critical hit threshold for attacks made with the altered spell is reduced by 3.

## Lore Seeking

At level 14, the power of your rune seeking magic grows, letting you learn much broader types of information. When you use the Rune Seeking downtime activity, you may choose to learn about characters or locations within the font of power instead. You may choose which type of entity you wish to learn about (treasure, character or location) after each entity is revealed for the Breadth option. You may choose any character or location that has been uncovered, you have met or you have visited for the Depth option.

When you uncover a character with the Breadth option, you learn their name, basic appearance and loyalty towards any other creatures or factions that you know.

When you uncover a location with the Breadth option, you learn its basic appearance (averaged over the past year), approximate location, and any vantages that the arena may contain.

## Runic Alteration: Script

At level 15, you master your fourth and final technique; altering the script of the inscribed rune in a way that changes the fundamental components of the spell.
Learn one of the following three alterations. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to apply any number of alterations that you know.

<div class="side-panel">

| **School**  | **Elements**              | **Ailments**                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Arcanology  | arcane, eldritch, water   | banished, crazed, chilled        |
| Energetics  | radiant, umbral, air      | hapless, cursed, aloft           |
| Technomancy | electric, corrosion, fire | frightened, defenseless, blinded |
| Viviculture | primal, decay, earth      | rooted, withered, blunted        |

</div>

### Colorful Alteration

Change the elemental damage type dealt by the altered spell to one of the three associated with your school of magic, shown in the table in the sidebar.

### Bold Alteration

Change all stacks of ailments applied by the altered spell to one of the three associated with your school of magic, shown in the table in the sidebar.

### Fundamental Alteration

Change the special attack type used by the altered spell to correspond to an attribute of your choice.

## Allure of the Unknown

At level 18, the dangerous wilds and ruins of the world call to you, strengthening your resolve as you seek to uncover their deepest secrets. Whenever you complete a rest (other than by spending Resolve) in an area with a danger level of 1 or higher, gain a Resolve.

## Pinnacle of Knowledge

At level 20, you have reached the current pinnacle of knowledge of your magic, and begin to invent new techniques.

You gain access to the Scholarship downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, you may replace any of your class decision (such as one of your spells or alterations known), replacing it with another choice from the same class feature.

In addition, you gain a powerful bonus that improves your spells, as described in the section for your school of magic.

# Schools of Magic

FLUFF. Students of arcanology focus on teleportation, invisibility and controlling ailments.

### Runic Alteration: Arcane Style

As a student of arcanology, select one of the following runic alterations at level 15.

#### Exchange

When you hit a creature with the altered spell, you may trade any number of stacks of ailments affecting you for the same number of ailments affecting the target hit. If you hit multiple creatures with the altered spell, trade with each creature in the sequence of your choice.

#### Grandiosity

The altered spell targets every creature on the battlefield, other than yourself. This ignores line of sight, the hidden status and range, but not the banished ailment.

#### Weirding

After you hit a creature with a spell that uses this alteration, swap positions with them via teleportation. If you hit multiple creatures with this spell, choose one.

### Pinnacle of Magic: Riftwalking

At level 20, you unlock the final secrets of arcanology, opening a rift in reality as you cast your spells. After a spell that you cast completes, teleport up to 3 tiles. This effect occurs after any attack of opportunity triggered is resolved.

## Energetics

**Academic skill:** Fontcraft

FLUFF. Students of energetics focus on applying forced movement and manipulating afflictions.

### Runic Alteration: Energetics

As a student of Energetics, select one of the following runic alterations at level 15.

#### Conservation

All forced movement applied by the altered spell moves you the same distance in the opposite direction.

#### Inversion

The direction of all forced movement applied by the altered spell is reversed.

### Pinnacle of Magic: Free Energy

At level 20, you unlock the final secrets of Energetics, allowing you to tap into the practically limitless energy of the fonts. Whenever you use the Essence Tap minor action, restore all of your essence.

### Runic Alteration: Technomantic Style

As a student of Technomancy, select one of the following runic alterations at level 15.

#### Antimatter

The altered spell does not deal damage. Instead, it grants absorption equal to the damage that it would have dealt, after it would have been modified by resistance, vulnerability, critical strikes or similar effects.

#### Excess

The damage dealt by the altered spell is doubled. Lose life equal to the damage you deal with the altered spell.

#### Overdrive

The altered spell is automatically a critical if you hit. After you cast the altered spell, skip your next turn.

### Pinnacle of Magic: Automation

At level 20, you unlock the final secrets of Technomancy, allowing you to automate away the tedious and dangerous work of actually drawing sigils. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to first create a simulacra in an empty tile of your choice within a 3 tile range. If you do, the simulacra casts the spell instead of you. It shares your statistics and any effects other than temporary boons or conditions, and cannot act other than to cast the spell. After the spell completes, the simulacra crumbles to nothingness.

To clarify the rules for this feature more exactly:

- All ranges and positioning requirements are computed relative to this simulacra, rather than you.
- You do not share life pools with this simulacra: any damage taken resolves separately.
- If you selected the Focused Casting option for your Elaborate Runes class feature, the simulacra must maintain its concentration rather than you.
- If you selected the Risky Casting option for your Elaborate Runes class feature, the simulacra provokes the attack of opportunity rather than you.

#### Harvest

When you cast the altered spell, remove all absorption that you have from yourself. The spell deals additional damage equal to the absorption removed in this way. This extra damage is affected by efficacy in the usual fashion and is of the same damage type as the altered spell.

### Pinnacle of Magic: Cultivation

At level 20, you unlock the final secrets of viviculture, allowing you to shape the terrain with your living magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to spread tile effects with your spell. When you do, copy all source tile effects to the destination tiles, replacing any other tile effects there.

**Source tile effects** are all tile effects in tiles that you are currently occupying. If there are no source tile effects, this feature removes all tile effects when copying. The **destination tiles** are all tiles occupied by the creatures targeted by your spell plus every tile that would be affected by your spell.
