# Paragon

**Source of Power:** Singularly committed to their ideals, the strength of the Paragon’s conviction shines through for everyone around them to see, and gives them the strength to stand proud in the face of overwhelming adversity.

**Core Mechanic:** Paragons prime auras: powerful persistent powers that affect either allies or enemies that are near them. These auras are tile effects, and when combined with their powerful Stand Your Ground feature make Paragons a battlefield feature to play around all by themselves.

**Specialization:** Each Paragon is committed to an ideal, which flavors their non-aura powers; giving them a benefit when they stand without moving and enhancing their Strike and Grapple major actions.

**Approach to Adventure:** Paragons excel at convincing others of their ideals’ merits and eventually gain access to the Sanctify downtime activity, marking an area as completely safe, setting the stage for negotiation.

**Build Fundamentals:** Paragons can be built for either a controller or guardian role, depending on how they prefer to position in a fight:

- Controller: Hold your ground in the middle of the enemy’s line and select auras that affect your enemies and focus on keeping yourself alive. Grappling can be a great addition, letting you force enemies to stay in range of your auras.
- Guardian: Plant your feet just in front of your backline, keeping your enemies from getting close to your allies as you enhance their effectiveness with your auras. Make sure they’re adjacent to you, so that you can use your incredibly powerful Block reaction to protect them should they get hit.

## Auras

Paragons radiate confidence to all around them: **auras** are the tangible manifestation of this. At level 1, you radiate an aura at all times. At the start of each of your turns, you may pay 1 essence and choose one of the auras that you know. If you do, a 2 tile radius around you gains the tile effect described in that power's description. You inspire different effects in your allies and your foes: each aura affects either all enemy or all ally creatures. Trigger any tile effects after you gain your aura for the turn.

You learn 3 auras at level 1 selected from the [Paragon Auras](../powers/paragon-auras.md) section of the book. You learn an additional aura at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19.

## Cause

Each Paragon embodies one of the ideals of the world, and has a **Cause** they deeply believe in that is aligned with this ideal, This may be a religious crusade, a movement for social change, the protection of a king or forest, or even a belief that they are the rightful ruler of the land.

Pursuing this Cause colors or drives everything that a Paragon does. Its draw is inescapable, even if their actions are sometimes unrelated out of necessity. At level 1, they commit themselves to this Cause, gaining unique features depending on which Ideal they embody beginning at level 1 and continuing as they grow in power.

### Hold Your Ground

At level 1, your belief in your Cause gives you the strength needed to hold a position without faltering. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose to stand firm in order to gain a unique and powerful personal benefit. Until the start of your next turn, you cannot spend movement and are immune to forced movement.

### Fervent Blows

At level 5, the Cause adds extra moral weight to their strikes. Whenever you use the Strike or Grapple major action, you may pay 1 essence to inflict a secondary effect unique to your Cause if you hit.

## Muster

When you reach level 2, your confidence and conviction is apparent to all you speak to. When attempting to convince someone to act to directly benefit your Cause, you have advantage on all Guidance and Charm skill checks made.

## Faith is my Shield

Also at level 2, your belief shields you from harm, granting additional protection when you use the Block reaction. After you use the Block reaction, you may spend essence up to your proficiency bonus to prevent additional damage. For every point of essence spent in this way, prevent 4 additional damage from the initial attack blocked.

## Intervention

At level 3, you gain an unflinching willingness to step in front of blows meant for your allies. You may use your Block reaction to reduce the efficacy of attacks made against any creature within your zone of control, rather than just yourself. When you do so, you take any other effects of that attack in their place as well and they gain any additional effects of your Block reaction.

## Martyr

Also at level 3, being wounded in the course of doing what is right only deepens your resolve. At the end of each turn in which you lost life, gain 1 essence and 2 absorption.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

## Sanctify

At level 6, you are able to call for an enforced peace through the strength of your belief. You gain access to the Sanctify downtime activity, and can cause a 12 tile radius centered at your location to become the site of an enforced peace.

## Stand Proud

As a minor action, make a melee Presence attack against a creature within a 2 tile range. If you hit, make a Presence (Guidance) skill check. Apply 1 stack of taunted for every 5 points of the skill check result, rounded down.

## Unassailable

At level 9, the Paragon’s belief in the cause bolsters their shield. Once per round after you use the Block reaction, you may spend 1 essence to refund your reaction. This ability refreshes at the start of each of your turns.

## Unwavering

Once you reach level 10, you are unwavering in your convictions, and nearly impossible to sway by either mundane or magical means. Presence attacks or skill checks made against you have disadvantage.

## Rallying Blow

## Armistice

At level 14, you are able to immediately put an end to combat, and force the combatants to negotiate. Once per rest as a major action you can gain the benefit of the Sanctify downtime activity.

## Stand with Me

At level 15, your allies share in your strength as you hold the line against impossible odds. Whenever you use your Hold Your Ground subclass feature by sacrificing your movement for the turn, allies within 2 tiles may choose to give up their movement until the end of their next turn in order to also gain its benefit.

## Together as One

At level 17, your conviction radiates intensely, bolstering your allies and cowing your foes like never before. At the start of each of your turns, you may pay 1 additional essence to activate a second aura of your choice. You must choose two different auras.

## Redemption

As a downtime activity, you may attempt to Sway a creature that you can have a focused conversation with. Make a difficulty 25 Presence (Guidance) skill check, adding their loyalty towards you to the skill check result.
If you succeed, their value in your chosen Ideal permanently increases by 1. This skill check benefits from your Muster feature. If you fail this skill check by 10 or more their loyalty towards you decreases by 1.
