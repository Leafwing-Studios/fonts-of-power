# Skill Talents

Skill talents let you further specialize in a skill you are already proficient in.

## Anima: Instinctive

You have advantage on skill checks made to learn more about monsters when using the Scan minor action.

You have advantage on all skill checks made to use the Harvest downtime activity to gather essence crystals.

## Arcana: Scholarly

When you use the Prepare downtime activity, gain its benefit a second time.

Your magical abilities are more flexible than most: as long as you can plausibly describe how specific magical powers that you have would help you accomplish your task, you can use Arcana in place of other skills outside of combat.

## Athletics: Eager

After you have succeeded on an Athletics skill check, you may choose to help any creature attempting to perform the same action. If you do, they have advantage on the Athletics skill check.

You have advantage on all Athletics skill checks made to break things.

## Charm: Persuasive

Treat any Presence (Charm) skill check made to persuade NPCs about their self-interest in a deal as if you had rolled 10 higher.

Whenever you fail a Charm skill check while lying (including when making deals), you may make one (but only one) attempt to correct your story, telling a new lie and making a new skill check.

## Craftsmanship: Industrious

You are able to readily substitute, salvage or jerry-rig materials and tools and have advantage on all Supply die rolls.

While investigating a mundane object, you are able to determine its approximate origin and method of creation.

## Endurance: Stalwart

Whenever you complete a rest, remove an additional stack of exhaustion.

## Fontcraft: Adventurous

While you are able to orient yourself in any fashion, you cannot get lost, and always know the rough direction towards any landmark.

While at a font of power, you have advantage on all skill checks made during the Enchant downtime activity if the affix in question shares an element with the font of power.

## Guidance: Motivating

When you use the Support downtime option, you enable one additional creature to perform an extra downtime activity.

You no longer have disadvantage on skill checks to temporarily change the ideals of NPCs you are making a deal with when your personal morality does not align with the stance you are taking.

## Humanities: Astute

When you interact with a new group of creatures, you may make a Humanities skill check against difficulty 15 to determine the rough political dynamics of the group.

You have advantage on all skill checks made to speak, understand, read or write unfamiliar languages.

## Insight: Intuitive

When you make a Presence (Insight) skill check to learn the ideals of an NPC, you learn the exact values of the ideals that they hold, rather than learning only the most and least important ideal to them.

You have advantage on any skill check made to gain a clue from the worldspeaker.

## Medicine: Compassionate

Whenever you succeed at a skill check to Tend to a creature during downtime, they can benefit from both effects, recovering one additional exhaustion and restoring half their life.

Whenever you successfully treat a creature using the Medicine skill, if their loyalty was previously negative it becomes 0 instead.

## Perception: Observant

Creatures trying to use Stealth to hide from you never have advantage due to you being distracted or hurried.

Whenever you take the Scan minor action on your turn and have not spent movement yet this turn, you may choose to gain advantage on the skill check. If you do, you may not spend movement until the start of your next turn.

## Stealth: Mysterious

You have advantage on all Stealth skill checks made during chases.

You have advantage on all Stealth checks made to hide while not moving.

## Tinkering: Inventive

You produce 1 more consumable whenever you use the Devise downtime activity.

You have advantage on checks made during Prepared for Anything when attempting to create mechanical devices.

## Trickery: Devious

You no longer suffer disadvantage on attempts made to steal an item that is closely guarded, such as those in a pocket.

You gain access to the Counterfeit downtime activity. If you succeed on a difficulty 20 Trickery skill check, you can create a false identity, complete with contacts, false documents and a plausible cover story.
