# Talents

This is the root page for all the talents in the game. Talents are innate, largely non-magical aspects of who your character is: making them distinct from others of the same class and species.
Each talent is also a 1 gear point affix with the same name, and counts against the maximum number of stacks for that affix.

When you create your character, select on skill talent and one combat talent. You must be proficient in the skill corresponding to the skill talent that you select.
