# Soulbinder

**Source of Power:** Forming a connection between their own soul and another through physical contact, Soulbinders manipulate this bond to transmit strange pulses to and from their dual.

**Core Mechanic:** After landing a basic attack (or using the Treat minor action on an ally), Soulbinders mark their target as their dual. So long as their concentration holds, they can use Pulses which affect one creature or the other (and eventually both), specializing in manipulating afflictions, ailments and absorption.

**Specialization:** Each Soulbinder’s connection has a distinctive Qualia: influencing how it feels, and granting the Soulbinder access to a unique pulse, a specialized downtime activity and powerful playstyle-defining combat features at higher levels.

**Approach to Adventure:** Soulbinders make for excellent spies, scouts and assassins: gaining access to features that improve their ability to manipulate their duals, while several of their pulses enhance their stealth capabilities.

**Build Fundamentals:** Soulbinders can be built to be insidious controllers, dedicated guardians or even assassin-esque strikers:

- Controller: Focus on completely locking down a single target with ailments and afflictions and mitigate their effects on yourself with armor affixes like _ailment immunity_. The _imbued strikes_ and _cruel strikes_ affixes are very useful to allow your basic attacks to generate more stacks.
- Guardian: Specialize in protecting and empowering a single ally with absorption and subtly supportive effects. Ranged weapons with the _harmless strikes_ affix can be a great option for quickly swapping targets when they’re outside the range of your Treat minor action.
- Striker: The soul burst pulse will be your bread and butter, encouraging you to blend your pulses with your enhanced basic attacks. Isolate a single target and then focus them down relentlessly, selecting pulses that remove their ability to defend themselves or rejoin the group.

## Soul Binding

When a Soulbinder touches a creature, a fleeting connection is forged, linking their souls together in a way that the soulbinder can use to help or harm their target.

Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack, Shove attack, Grapple attack or use the Treat minor action on them, you become **bound** to them, and they become your **dual.** You do not need to attempt to remove ailments or afflictions from your ally in order to gain this benefit. You may only have one dual at a time; hitting a new creature with a basic attack or using the Treat minor action on a new creature replaces any existing connection.

Outside of combat, merely touching a creature, such as by shaking their hand or bumping into them, is sufficient to create this bond.

While you are bound to a dual, you may use **pulses**, exploiting the connection formed to send a carefully crafted payload of essence to or from them. Pulses always take a minor action and cost 1 essence. Every pulse has two effects available to select: one that primarily affects you, and one that primarily affects the creature you are bound to. When you use a pulse, choose one of these effects.

While you are bound to a creature, you may apply a pulse to your dual,

Pulses work somewhat differently than other powers due to the sustained connection formed:

- At the start of each of your turns, if you are more than 12 tiles away from your dual the connection is broken.
  - This ignores line of sight, and scales with modifications to the range of your powers.
  - If the target is hidden, measure from their closest hiding spot.
- If your concentration is broken, the connection is broken.
- When the connection is broken, all ongoing effects due to a pulse (other than ailments, afflictions or absorption applied) immediately end.
- Even though your pulses are ranged attacks, you do not have disadvantage on attacks made with your pulses due to being in an enemy zone of control.
- You do not need to have line of sight to your dual (or know where they are hidden) to affect your dual with a pulse.
- If you hit an enemy dual with a pulse attack while they are hidden they are automatically revealed.

You learn one pulse at level 1 selected from the [Soulbinder Pulses](../powers/soulbinder-pulses.md) section of the book. You learn an additional pulse at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. You also learn the two following pulses immediately upon gaining this feature, which do not count against your pulses known. Choose the type of damage that soul burst deals when you learn it.

### Soul Burst

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

An overwhelming surge of essence flows through your bond; empowering you but damaging the other creature. Choose one:

- You have advantage on your next basic attack made before the end of your next turn.
- Make a special attack against Focus against your dual. If you hit, deal 1d8 + Presence damage of the type chosen when you learned this pulse.

### Strange Symbiosis

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

Souls twining together, you and your dual grow in strength. Choose one:

- Transfer all of your absorption to your dual, then gain 6 + Presence absorption.
- Transfer all your dual’s absorption to you, then grant them 6 + Presence absorption.

Like with all other pulses, when you use this pulse with your Bidirectional Connection class feature, you may choose which order these effects resolve in.

## Sixth Sense

Also at level 1, the connection formed gives you a vague awareness of the other's surroundings and actions, helping you react quickly to protect or harm your dual.

If your dual is an ally, attacks of opportunity against either of you are made with disadvantage.

If your dual is an enemy, attacks of opportunity against your dual are made with advantage.

## Qualia

The connection that each soulbinder forms has a distinctive Qualia to it, almost like a taste, shaping the nature of their bond. This selection grants you unique features both at level 1 and as you grow in power.

### Distinctive Pulse

At level 1, you learn a unique Pulse, in addition to the one you select, soul burst and soul soothe.

## Reflection

At level 6, you gain access to a new downtime activity that takes advantage of your ability to form bonds with other creatures.

### Coping Strategy

At level 15, your A Sorrow Shared feature is enhanced based on your Qualia.

### Soulbound

At level 20, the bond you form between souls is deep and rich, full of the Qualia that defines your bond. While you are bound to another creature, both you and that creature are affected by a powerful passive effect.

## Empathy

When you reach level 2, emotions subtly travel across the soul bond you have formed, letting both you and your partner pick up on the other’s emotions more easily. You have advantage on all Charm, Guidance, and Insight skill checks made with respect to a creature you are bonded with.

You have disadvantage on all skill checks made to lie to or otherwise deceive your dual, including when you (or a party member you are in the presence of) selects the Deception option during Deals and Ideals.

## A Sorrow Shared

Also at level 2, your pain passes through the bond between your souls, causing the pain suffered to be shared between the two of you.

If your dual is an ally:

- Split all damage taken by either of you evenly between the two of you.
- At the end of each of your turns while you are bound to an ally and not at full life, spend essence equal to your proficiency bonus and gain four times that much life.
- You and your ally have advantage on all Endurance skill checks made to maintain your concentration while bound together, but must make a concentration check whenever either of you lose life.

If your dual is any other creature, whenever you would lose life:

- Spend essence equal to your proficiency bonus.
- Reduce the life lost by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus, to a minimum of 0 life lost.
- Deal damage equal to the amount that was reduced in this way to your dual. This damage is of the same type as you would have originally suffered.
- Gain that much absorption.

## Amplitude Moderation

Also at level 3, you learn to carefully control the strength of your pulses, spreading out the power spike over time. You may use your Pulse minor action at no essence cost when you use it as a major action. As a result, you may now use your pulses as attacks of opportunity, so long as they involve an attack roll against your dual.

## Precognition

At level 3, your connection to the soul of your dual allows you to respond to their shifting situations, reading their intent before they even begin to act.

If your dual is an ally, at the start of their turn you may spend your reaction to use a pulse of your choice that affects them. As always, you cannot spend essence as part of this reaction.

If your dual is an enemy, whenever they lose life, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Bidirectional Connection

At level 5, you are able to send pulses in both directions across your bond at once. Once during your turn, you may spend 1 essence to apply both effects of your pulse.

## Parting Gift

Upon reaching level 7, you can send a final pulse through your connection as it breaks. Whenever your bond with another creature breaks, you may use your reaction to make an attack of opportunity using a pulse of your choice, affecting your previous dual.

## Transmission

At level 9, you are able to manipulate ailments of all sorts through your bond, curing them from your allies and transferring them to your foes. Immediately after you use a pulse, you may spend 1 additional essence to transfer one stack of a ailment or two stacks of an affliction of your choice to or from your dual.

## Soul Searching

At level 10, you are able to sense the souls of those you have recently marked, no matter how far away or well-hidden they might be. Whenever you use the Scan minor action, you may choose to learn the direction and distance to a specific creature that you have bound to since you last completed a rest.

## Amplification

When you reach level 11, you learn to amplify suffering with your strikes. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack, you may add a stack of a ailment that they are already suffering from to them.

## Throughput

When you reach level 13, you are able to transmit large quantities of essence over your bond. You can now use your Bidirectional Connection feature any number of times during your turn.

## Soul Meld

At level 14, you learn to become one with the creature you are bound to, disappearing into their soul until you choose to break free once again. As a major action, you can Meld into your dual, becoming banished until either:

- You choose to end this effect at the start of one of your turns.
- Your connection to your dual breaks.
- The party completes a rest.

When the effect ends, you appear in an empty tile of your choice adjacent to the creature you are bound to.

While you are melded with another creature, you retain all of your senses and your bond cannot be broken. The creature you are bound to is unaware of the fact that you have melded with them. If the creature you are melded to becomes unconscious this effect ends.

### Driven Pulse

By level 17, you are able to transmit pulses as you first form a connection with your foe’s soul. Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack, you may immediately cast a pulse, paying its essence cost like usual.

## Lingering Taste

At level 18, you can clearly remember the qualia of any soul you have bound to before, no matter how much time has passed. You automatically recognize if you have previously been bound to a creature when you bind with it again, and your Soul Searching feature can now be used to find any creature that you have been bound to before, no matter how long ago it was.

# Qualia

## Dreams

### Distinctive Pulse: Sweet Dreams

At level 1, you gain access to the following Distinctive Pulse.

#### Sweet Dreams

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

A wave of calm, restful energy flows through your bond, as you lull them into restful dreams while sheltering them from harm. Choose one:

- Remove all ailments and afflictions from yourself. Then, apply two stacks of pacified and blinded to yourself.
- Make a special attack against Focus against your dual. If you hit, remove all ailments and afflictions from them. Then, apply one stack of pacified and blinded to your dual.

### Reflection: Visitation

At level 6, you gain access to the Visitation downtime activity, allowing you to influence the dreams of those you have been bound to. When you use this downtime activity, select a creature you have been bound to at some point before your last rest and choose whether peaceful dreams or nightmares occur.

If you select peaceful dreams, gain the benefit of the Tend downtime activity targeting them, making the Focus (Medicine) skill check with advantage.

If you select nightmares, their next rest does not restore any life or remove any exhaustion.

### Coping Strategy: Toss and Turn

At level 15, you are able to transmit terrible nightmares over your bond. Damage transferred via your A Sorrow Shared feature does not break the pacified ailment and cannot be prevented in any way.

### Soulbound: Figment of the Imagination

At level 20, you are able to slip in and out of the soul of the creature you are bound to freely, causing those who might see you to question whether you were truly there at all. You may now use your Soul Meld feature as a minor action and are immune to damage while soul melded.

## Hunger

### Distinctive Pulse: Blood Trail

At level 1, you gain access to the following Distinctive Pulse.

#### Blood Trail

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

A wound appears out of nowhere on the creature you are bound to and they are filled with a terrifying sense that they are being chased, causing them to leave a trail of blood behind them as they flee. Choose one:

- Gain the benefit of the Dash minor action twice. Until the start of your next turn, you cannot willingly move away from your dual if you know where they are.
- Make a special attack against Presence against the creature you are bound to. If you hit, apply frightened and 3 stacks of bleeding.

### Reflection: Seance

At level 6, you gain access to the Seance downtime activity, allowing you to use your connection between souls to speak to the recently dead. When you use this downtime activity, select a creature of your choice that you have been bound to in the period since you last completed a rest and is now dead. They appear before you as a spirit, and you (and those in your presence) may speak to them at length.

This does not change the spirit’s attitude towards you in any way, or grant you any special ability to communicate with them, although they appear in the state they were in when you were last bound to them.

### Coping Strategy: Feast

At level 15, your A Sorrow Shared feature now lets you feast on the souls of the fallen. When your dual dies, you may use your reaction to consume their soul. Spend any amount of essence to regain four times that much life. Creatures that you use this feature on cannot be resurrected in any way.

After you use this feature you are satiated and cannot use it again until you complete a rest.

### Soulbound: Ravenous

At level 20, you leap at every opening and snap ravenously at every missed opportunity. Whenever the creature you are bound to misses with an attack, the next attack that you make before the end of your next turn is automatically a critical if it hits.

## Plague

### Distinctive Pulse: Twisted Remedy

At level 1, you gain access to the following Distinctive Pulse.

#### Twisted Remedy

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

As your bond cures afflictions, so too does it apply new ones in turn. Choose one:

- Make a special attack against Focus against your dual. If you hit, transfer all of your afflictions to them, then apply 6 + Presence stacks of anguish to yourself.
- Make a special attack against Focus against your dual. If you hit, transfer all their afflictions to you, then apply 6 + Presence stacks of anguish to them.

Like with all other pulses, when you use this pulse with your Bidirectional Connection class feature, you may choose which order these effects resolve in.

### Reflection: Vex

At level 6, you gain access to the Vex downtime activity, allowing you to exploit the connection between souls to wear your enemies thin. When you use this downtime activity, select a creature that you have been bound to since you last completed a rest. They gain two stacks of exhaustion.

Your Tend downtime activity now removes an additional level of exhaustion.

### Coping Strategy: Torment

At level 15, your pain transmits perfectly through your bond. Life lost due to afflictions does not count against your cap of damage transferred for your A Sorrow Shared feature.

### Soulbound: Misery

At level 20, your bond worries and gnaws at those it affects. At the end of each of your turns while you are bound to another creature, apply 3 stacks of anguish to each of you.

## Serenity

### Distinctive Pulse: Power’s Price

#### Power’s Price

**Cost:** 1

**Casting time:** Minor action

**Range:** Special

**Duration:** Instant

The energy flowing through your bond offers tremendous power, but forces you and your dual to consider the consequences of your actions. Choose one:

- Attacks you make before the end of your next turn are automatically criticals if you hit, but you also suffer any of the attacks’ effects.
- The next attack your dual makes before the end of your next turn are automatically criticals if they hit, but they also suffer any of the attacks’ effects.

### Reflection: Together as One

At level 6, you are able to use the strength of your bond between souls to mystically bolster your cooperation with an ally. You may now gain the benefit of the Bond downtime activity with any creature you have been bound to since you last completed a rest without them needing to also use this downtime activity.

### Coping Strategy: Karma

At level 15, your A Sorrow Shared feature changes in effectiveness based on the relative health of you and the creature you are paired with. While your dual is an ally, all damage taken by either of you is taken by the creature with a higher life total.

While your dual is not an ally:

- If you have more life than them, the maximum amount of damage that can be transferred by your A Sorrow Shared feature is halved.
- If you have less life than them, the maximum amount of damage that can be transferred by your A Sorrow Shared feature is doubled.

### Soulbound: Balance In All Things

At level 20, your connection automatically seeks to restore the balance of things, compensating for any damage taken by shielding the other partner in the bond. Whenever you lose life, the creature you are bound to gains that much absorption and vice versa.
