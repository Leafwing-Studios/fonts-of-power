"Flair","Name","Effect"
"Favored One","Plot Armor","First time an attack would bring you to death's door, the attack is treated as if it missed instead."
"Magician","Finale","Once per rest, when a trick that you have placed is about to detonate, you may gain the effects of any two different tricks that you know instead. You choose the order in which these resolve."
"Ruffian","Quick on the Draw","Once per rest, you may act during a surprise round when you otherwise would not be able to. This feature works even if there would not otherwise be a surprise round."
