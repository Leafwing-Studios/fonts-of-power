"Name","Effect"
"Point Blank Alteration","The altered spell becomes melee, with a range equal to your zone of control. As a result, you no longer have disadvantage on attacks made with this spell while in an enemy zone of control. When used in concert with an alteration from your Runic Alteration: Quantifier class feature, the area of effect is centered around you, rather than a tile of your choice within range (although you may choose the direction of any relevant effects), although it does not affect you."
"Swelling Alteration","You have disadvantage on attacks made with the altered spell against targets within half of the range of the spell, and advantage on all other attacks made with the altered spell."
"Offset Alteration","When you cast a spell with this alteration, choose a different tile within a 2 tile range. The spell originates from that tile instead."
