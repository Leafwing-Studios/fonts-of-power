# Weaver

**Source of Power:** Carefully manipulating the threads of magic that underlie reality, Weavers are masters of the arcane, creating and destroying matter and warping time and space with deft hands and a quick mind.

**Core Mechanic:** Weavers work their magic through Patterns: simple, subtle spells that take effect at the end of the Weaver’s turn. While the Weaver’s concentration holds, these Patterns can be sustained at the cost of essence, allowing them to carefully manipulate the entire battlefield as they stay out of harm's way.

**Specialization:** Each Weaver belongs to a Guild, which specializes in a particular discipline of the craft. This grants them access to specialized patterns, and allows them to shape reality itself during downtime.

**Approach to Adventure:** Weavers can see and read the threads of magic, a coveted skill in a world brimming with dangerous and tantalizing magical traps, items and phenomena. Their downtime activities gained through their Guild are both powerful and flexible, and tend to become central to the Weaver’s contribution to the party’s problem solving.

**Build Fundamentals:** Depending on their selection of patterns, weavers can serve as flexible and responsive strikers, controllers or guardians:

- Striker: select a damaging pattern that matches your playstyle and then amplify its effectiveness with your other patterns and gear. _Pattern of annihilation,_ _pattern of animation,_ and _pattern of destruction_ all reward very different builds, making it more effective to specialize or swap arms when you swap patterns.
- Controller: pick up patterns that apply ailments or restrict space like _pattern of binding_ or _pattern of forbiddance_. Prioritize locking down the enemies that are trying to break your concentration to make sure you can keep the situation under control.
- Guardian: select a blend of offensive (like _pattern of augmentation_ and _pattern of empowerment_) and defensive (like _pattern of absorption_ or _pattern of warding_) patterns, so you can adapt to the situation as it evolves. Absorption is an extremely effective defensive option as your concentration is only tested when you lose life, not when you take damage.

## Weave Magic

As a Weaver, you manipulate the very fabric of magic, carefully shifting and crafting the arcane threads. Beginning at level 1, you learn to weave **patterns,** magical spells which can be sustained to create lasting effects so long as your concentration holds, slowly transforming your essence into tangible effects.

Weaving a pattern takes a major action, but does not cost any essence. Patterns always affect a single creature (or object or small area) at a time, and they only deal arcane damage.

Weavers can **sustain** their patterns for lasting effects. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose to sustain any pattern that you cast or were sustaining last turn. Sustaining a pattern costs 1 essence, and you may only sustain one pattern at a time at level 1.

At the end of each of your turns, gain the effects of any patterns you cast that turn or that you were sustaining.
Like always, your simultaneous effects resolve in the order of your choice.
For the purpose of effects such as the _encouraging_ combat talent, patterns which later apply boons (such as _pattern of absorption_) count as applying boons at the end of the turn when they trigger.

Patterns work somewhat differently than other powers due to the sustained connection formed:

- You cannot sustain patterns on targets that are more than 12 tiles away from you.
  - This ignores line of sight, and scales with modifications to the range of your powers.
  - If the target is hidden, measure from their closest hiding spot.
- If your concentration is broken, you cannot sustain patterns at the start of your next turn.
- You can sustain patterns even while otherwise impaired (such as if you were banished, stunned or pacified); only casting new patterns is affected.
- Even though your patterns are ranged attacks, you do not have disadvantage on attacks made with your patterns due to being in an enemy zone of control.
- You do not need to have line of sight to your dual to affect a creature with a pattern you have sustained or already cast (but you do need to have line of sight and see them).
- If the target of your pattern is hidden, you do not need to know where they are (although patterns do not reveal their position if they hit).

You learn 4 patterns at level 1 selected from the [Weaver Patterns](../powers/weaver-patterns.md) section of the book. You learn an additional pattern at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19.

## Guild

Each Weaver belongs to a professional association, a Guild, which specializes in a particular style of manipulating the Weave. At level 1, each Weaver joins a Guild of their choice, unlocking benefits both immediately and as they grow in power.

### Signature Pattern

When you select a Guild at level 1 you gain access to an exclusive pattern that does not count towards your limit of patterns known.

### Reality Weaving

At level 6 you learn to use the techniques of your guild to carefully alter reality, gaining access to or improving a downtime activity.

### Elaborate Pattern

When you reach level 11, you gain access to a second exclusive pattern that does not count towards your limit of patterns known.

### World Weaving

At level 18, you have mastered the downtime activity learned at level 6, and are able to use it to perform truly world-shaping tasks.

## Sense the Weave

When you reach level 2, you can see magic in the world around you as faintly glowing threads. You can sense the presence or absence of magic on any item, creature or object that you can clearly see. Learning the nature of this magic requires a successful Expertise (Arcana) skill check.

## Mending

At level 2, the intense flow of magical energy runs through you, knitting your wounds together as it shrouds you in a magical barrier. Whenever you spend essence, you may spend that much essence again, gaining 4 life for each point of essence spent in this fashion.

## Warded by the Weave

At level 3, you wrap the threads of magic around you, distorting the fabric of space to protect you from blows. After you use the Block reaction, until the end of the current turn, after you lose life, gain that much absorption.

## Thread Twisting.

Also at 3rd level, you begin to master the true deftness required to work with the Weave. You gain access to the Twist minor action. When you use this action, choose one:

- change the target of one of the patterns that you have cast or sustained to another valid target
- replace one of the patterns you have cast or sustained with another pattern with the same target

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Flick of the Wrist

At 5th level, you can incorporate patterns into the movements you are already making, casting them more quickly. When you use the Twist minor action, you may spend 1 essence to cast an additional pattern of your choice on one of the targets of your Twist minor action. As always, you may choose the order in which your own effects apply if it is not clearly specified.

## Step through the Weave

When you reach level 7, you gain the ability to step through the Weave itself, teleporting a short distance. You gain access to the Telegraphed Teleportation power. As a minor action, choose a tile within a range equal to half your movement speed. At the start of your next turn, you may teleport into that tile. Any creatures that were occupying your new tiles are pushed harmlessly aside, into the empty tile of their choice.

## Split Focus

When you reach 9th level, you are able to split your focus across two different patterns at once. You can now sustain up to two patterns simultaneously, increasing to three at level 17.

As a reminder, when you choose to sustain a pattern at the start of your turn, you must spend 1 essence for each pattern sustained.

## Sleight of Hand

Once you reach 10th level, you learn to mask your patterns with ordinary movements and work with incredible subtlety. If you succeed on a difficulty 15 Agility (Trickery) skill check at the end of each turn that you cast or sustain a pattern, observers are completely unaware of the fact that you are using magic. You have disadvantage on this skill check if there is more than one observer or you are being closely watched.

## Mirrored Patterns

When you reach level 13, you learn to mirror the motions you are making with the other hand, producing two copies of the same effect. Whenever you cast a pattern as a major action (but not as a minor action or reaction), you may spend one essence to create a second copy of it. You do not need to use the same target for this pattern.

## Read the Weave

At level 14, you learn to decipher the tangles of magic written in the Weave. You have advantage on all skill checks made to determine facts about the magical nature of creatures, locations, effects, or items. This includes all skill checks made during the Examine downtime activity.

## Snapped Threads

When you reach level 15, the raw energy released whenever another creature causes your concentration to break banishes them into the Weave for a moment. Whenever another creature causes your concentration to break, make a special attack against Expertise against them, applying one stack of banished if you hit.

## Threads of Magic

At level 20, you can freely twist and shape magic to your will, altering the nature of strange effects. Whenever you cast or sustain a pattern targeting a single creature, remove one stack of an ailment of your choice from them, then add one stack of a (possibly different) ailment of your choice to them.

# Guilds

## Fate

Aloof and mysterious, the Guild of Fateweavers works in the shadows, observing and manipulating both the most important events in history and the subtle mundane lives which together build to a swell. Its students are taught the importance and danger of this role, and it often marks them as intractably different to those who might be their companions.

The populace views their existence as either unfounded fairytale, a group of unfair oppressors or minor saviours who might turn their fortunes around. Often, of course, flickering in their opinion based on their current circumstances.

Most of those in this guild view themselves as the guardians of fate, set on the thankless task of ensuring things happen as they should. But a few rogue elements reject this view, and take their power into their own hands, attempting to twist the threads of destiny into a tapestry of their own making, for weal or for woe.

### Signature Pattern: Pattern of Fate

At level 1 when you select this Guild, gain access to the following Signature Pattern.

#### Pattern of Fate

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Until the start of your next turn

Peering into the Weave, you glimpse the possibility of an alternate future, and carefully pull out that thread. At the end of each of your turns while this pattern is in effect, roll a d20 and set it aside.

One time before the end of your next turn, you may replace the roll made as part of an attack made by or against the target with the d20 you set aside. You can see the outcomes of an attack before deciding whether to use this ability.

### Reality Weaving: Meddle with Fate

At 6th level, you are able to meddle with the strings of fate as they wind through time. You gain access to the Meddle with Fate downtime activity. Make a difficulty 15 Focus (Arcana) skill check. If you succeed, the party gains a Resolve.

### Elaborate Pattern: Pattern of Reversal

At level 11, gain access to the following Elaborate Pattern for your Guild.

#### Pattern of Reversal

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 12 tiles
Duration: Until the start of your next turn

You unwind the threads of fate, allowing you to instantly snap motion back a few moments in time. While this pattern is in effect, at the end of each turn, you may return all creatures within range to the positions that they were in at the start of the current turn via teleportation. You may only do so once each round and must hit unwilling creatures with a special attack against Expertise in order to reverse their position.

If you are benefitting from multiple copies of this pattern, the number of times per round that you can use this effect increases accordingly.

### World Weaving: Ordain Destiny

At level 18, your mastery over the threads of fate is so great that you are able to take destiny itself into your own hands, succeeding against all odds time and again. Whenever the party spends a Resolve, make a difficulty 20 Focus (Arcana) skill check. If you succeed, recover that Resolve.

## Maker

An optimistic guild open to any who might display signs of this talent, they ply their crafts as the most expert craftspeople in the entire realm. Working with the very fabric of reality, they toil to create splendors, both magical and mundane for the love of art, the good of the people or unimaginable wealth.

Deeply prized, the few masters of this work are often sought after by the powerful as a unique tool, whether in pursuit of prosperity, vanity, or war. Commoners are easily awed (and often envious), but those who show a true love for creation have much to learn from any of the Guild of Makers that they might encounter.

Late at night within the guildhalls, there are rare but heated arguments over their role in society. In the view of the minority, their talents are wasted on the populace, and a new, superior utopia should be created.

### Signature Pattern: Pattern of Detritus

At level 1 when you select this Guild, gain access to the following Signature Pattern.

#### Pattern of Detritus

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Instant

As you open a rift in the Weave, strange assorted junk, once banished but now forgotten, comes pouring forth, cluttering the battlefield. At the end of each of your turns, choose 3 adjacent tiles within range, which become flooded with junk. Tiles filled with junk are difficult terrain and grant partial cover.

Creatures in tiles that are flooded with junk suffer no harmful effects. Clearing a tile full of junk takes a minute of dedicated work.

### Reality Weaving: Create

At 6th level, you learn to carefully unwind matter, erasing it as if it had never even existed. You gain access to the Create downtime activity. When you use this, you may freely create nonliving, nonmagical matter of any sort that you desire, as long as it fits in a 6 tile cube. Making items that require a degree of skill, such as glass, weapons, structural masonry or the like requires an appropriate Expertise (Crafting) skill check.

In addition, you have advantage on all skill checks made during the Craft downtime activity and never need to roll on the supplies die during it.

### Elaborate Pattern: Pattern of Creation

At level 11, gain access to the following Elaborate Pattern for your Guild.

#### Pattern of Creation

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Instant

Carefully weaving reality into solid form, you pull the threads together into a solid form. At the end of each of your turns, choose an empty tile within range. It becomes filled with a sturdy solid object of your own creation. This object grants full cover and blocks movement. Unless you are indoors, flying creatures can still pass over this object.

If a creature wishes to destroy this object, they must spend a minor action and make either a Presence (Arcana) or Prowess (Athletics) skill check, contested by your Presence (Arcana). Hastily made, the object crumbles to dust if they succeed.

### World Weaving: A Whole New World

At level 18, you are able to weave incredible creations into existence, creating whole buildings overnight, or the food to feed a whole population. You may now affect up to a 60 tile cube of material with your Create downtime activity.

## Tapestry

Consummate artists, the Guild of Tapestry is a loose collection of wanderers, seeking both their next meal and self actualization by weaving beautiful illusions and fantastical stories. In search of inspiration, they often find themselves, apprentice in tow, in the midst of all sorts of trouble, soaking in the wonders and horrors of the world.

To those they meet, they are often viewed with a wary fascination, beloved for their tales and talents but never fully believed. The most gifted often find themselves with a patron of sorts; funding and directing their escapades to ever more exotic and dangerous lands.

Sometimes, a Weaver of Tapestry becomes lost in their own tales, sowing chaos and confusion, discord and terror in their path, forgetting everything but the thrill of the reaction of the audience and the pure delight of true artistry.

### Signature Pattern: Pattern of Tapestry

At level 1 when you select this Guild, gain access to the following Signature Pattern.

#### Pattern of Tapestry

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Instant / Until the end of your next turn

You shape the Weave to create a vivid tapestry that takes root in the mind of a creature within range, persisting in their imagination. At the end of each of your turns, make a special attack against Expertise against a creature of your choice within range. If you hit, choose one:
Apply two stacks of blinded.
Create a hallucinatory scene of your choice which only the target can see, hear or sense in any fashion that persists until the end of your next turn, when this effect would repeat
This scene may change and respond as you see fit.
The creature affected can use the Scan minor action to examine the hallucination, making a Focus (Insight) check contested by your Expertise (Arcana) skill. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the effect ends.
While affected, the target treats the hallucination as if it were real. Anything unusual or illogical that occurs is rationalized away, although they may make a new contested skill check as a result of the new information.
Affected creatures cannot take damage from this effect.

### Reality Weaving: Tapestry of Tales

At 6th level, you are able to convince an audience of a single fact as you weave an elaborate magical tapestry for their minds. You gain access to the Tapestry of Tales downtime activity. Make a difficulty 20 Presence (Arcana) skill check, adding the audience’s loyalty to you to your skill check. If you succeed, they believe a single fact of your choice is true.

This effect cannot modify or remove existing memories, but instead convinces the target to seek some alternate explanation for any discordant facts that they may know.

Whenever the creature is presented with solid evidence that this fact is false, they may make a Focus (Insight) check contested by your Expertise (Arcana) skill check to end the effect and recognize the truth.

### Elaborate Pattern: Pattern of Mimicry

At level 11, gain access to the following Elaborate Pattern for your Guild.

#### Pattern of Mimicry

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Until the end of your next turn

Shaping the Weave, you mimic the forms of your allies, creating illusory copies for them to control. Choose a creature within range to copy. At the end of each of your turns, if a copy does not already exist due to this pattern, make an illusory copy of the creature, which appears in an empty tile adjacent to the creature that they’re copying.

Illusory copies act according to the wishes of the creature they are copying on their turns, and are capable of all of the same actions.

- The first time that an affected creature or its illusory double:
  - succeeds on a skill check
  - lands an attack (after damage was rolled and the choice to use the Block or Dodge reaction was used)
  - is hit by an attack
  - takes damage
    Roll a d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the illusory copy was targeted or made the attack, and the attack or skill check made has no effect.
    If so, the illusory copy disappears.
    As a party, you may spend a Resolve to modify the outcome of this d20.

When this pattern ends, the affected creature is able to choose freely which copy was real, and the illusory copy disappears.

### World Weaving: Shared Reality

At level 18, you are able to impart a whole set of beliefs or view of the world as you tell your tales. When you use your Tapestry of Tales downtime activity, you may convince the audience of up to three separate facts instead.

### Unmaker

The most feared of the guilds, the Unmakers specialize in severing the threads holding together reality. Their teachings hold that flaws in the tapestry are an inevitable and unfortunate occurrence: when they occur, it is the Unmakers' job to cut them out of the fabric of existence.

Working as ruthless monster hunters or inscrutable assassins, their footsteps echo with whispers wherever they travel. From the outside, their purposes seem unknowable and their power terrible. But to the members of the guild, it is simple. Mistakes must be corrected.

Every so often, an Unmaker loses touch with reality, and goes rogue. Such guild members, when they have reached this state, begin to see reality itself as that which must be unmade, and present a major threat to civilization. They, of course, are merely yet another flaw in the tapestry.

### Signature Pattern: Pattern of Banishment

At level 1 when you select this Guild, gain access to the following Signature Pattern.

#### Pattern of Banishment

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Until the start of your next turn

Your target begins to slip from existence, their threads slowly unwinding. Select a creature or object within range. At the end of each of your turns, make a special attack against Focus against them. If you hit, apply two stacks of banished.

### Reality Weaving: Unweave

At 6th level, you learn to carefully unwind matter, erasing it as if it had never even existed. You gain access to the Unweave downtime activity. When you use this, you may permanently annihilate any nonliving matter that you can freely work on, as long as it fits in a 6-tile cube. This is a careful and deliberate process: you could use this to annihilate a chest but not its contents, a door but not the supporting wall, or even create sculptures with it.

In addition, you have advantage on all skill checks made during the Disenchant downtime activity.

### Elaborate Pattern: Pattern of Unravelling

At level 11, gain access to the following Elaborate Pattern for your Guild.

#### Pattern of Unravelling

Cost: 0
Casting time: Major action
Range: 6 tiles
Duration: Until the start of your next turn

Threads of magic begin to come undone as the Weave shies away from a creature of your choice within range. At the end of each of your turns, make a special attack against Focus against them. If you hit, apply two stacks of cursed..
World Weaving: Mass Annihilation
At level 18, your ability to carefully unweave existence is terrifying and world-shaking, letting you snip whole buildings or locations out of the fabric of reality. You may now affect up to a 60-tile cube of material with your Unweave downtime activity.
