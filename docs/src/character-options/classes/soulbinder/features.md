## Features

### Feats

**Details:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Soulbinding

**Level:** 1

**Details:** Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack, Shove attack or succesfully use the Treat action on them, form a **bond** to them. The creature that you are bonded to is referred to as your **dual**.

You are bonded to them until either:

- your concentration breaks
- you form a connection with a new creature

Forming bonds is not optional: hitting creatures with a new attack will change your connection.
Like always, if you hit multiple creatures with a single attack, you may choose the order in which the attacks resolve.

### Pulse

**Level:** 1

**Details:** 1 essence, 1 AP: affect yourself and dual with the chosen **pulse**.
