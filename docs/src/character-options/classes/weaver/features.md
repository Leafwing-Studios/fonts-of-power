### Patchwork

**Level:** 1

**Details:** When you successfully Treat a creature, you may make an Agility (Fontcraft) skill check with advantage. The result of that roll is **stored** on that creature. At any time, that creature may use the stored result in place of any other skill check or attack roll (after seeing the roll). Creatures may only have one result stored at a time. Using this feature again on a creature with a stored result replaces the original result.

### Sense the Weave

**Level:** 2

**Details:** You can sense the presence or absence of magic on any item, creature or object that you can clearly see. Learning the nature of this magic requires a successful Expertise (Fontcraft) skill check.

TODO 2022-10-23: Add guidelines for information gained from this skill check. Maybe we can make this a core part of the Fontcraft skill? Maybe instead we do a "number of questions" style design like with Scan.
