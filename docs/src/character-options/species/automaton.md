# Automaton

Brought to life by the surging energies of the world, these once inanimate objects are now fully sentient beings in their own right. Once a pure accident of fate, tinkerers (often automata themselves) now work diligently to reproduce this process, creating ever more splendid and useful forms for automata to inhabit.

The automata themselves form a scattered people, with an uneasy and conflicted relation to their origin. Some take pride and satisfaction in their work, happily performing the tasks they were designed for, while others resent that they were once created for a purpose. Some scrappy cities dominated by automata have begun to form, priding themselves on independence and the right to self-determination, including the modification of their own bodies to fit their own goals.

| Roll  | What do you think automata's role in society should be?                                                |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | Automata should try their best to fulfil the role they were made for with pride.                       |
|   2   | It is not my place to judge; every automata must decide for themselves how they feel about their role. |
|   3   | Automata deserve the same wages and worker's rights as any other species.                              |
|   4   | Creating automata for labour should be banned.                                                         |
|   5   | Automata must have full agency, and the workers must be liberated.                                     |
|   6   | The creation of automata is fundamentally immoral.                                                     |

| Roll  | How do you feel about modifying your body?                           |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was perfect the moment I was created.                              |
|   2   | I am uncomfortable with the ability to change the way my body works. |
|   3   | I am willing to tweak things that aren’t working for me.             |
|   4   | I will readily take on the form most suitable for the moment.        |
|   5   | I wish to become optimized.                                          |
|   6   | Bodies are for hacking.                                              |

| Roll  | Why did you leave your original role?  |
| :---: | -------------------------------------- |
|   1   | My creator was cruel or indifferent.   |
|   2   | I hated the work.                      |
|   3   | My creator or workplace was destroyed. |
|   4   | I was liberated or set free.           |
|   5   | I wanted to keep improving myself.     |
|   6   | I wanted to explore the world.         |

### Features {docsify-ignore}

**Inexhaustible:** Exhaustion no longer applies a penalty to your attack rolls.

**Clockwork Biology:** You are proficient in the Tinkering skill. Skill checks targeting you which use Anima or Medicine use Tinkering instead. This includes the relevant skill checks made as part of the Treat and Scan minor actions in combat.

**Inorganic:** You do not need to eat, drink, breathe or sleep. However, you must be maintained, either by yourself or a skilled technician, for 4 hours per day or you begin to malfunction, suffering exhaustion as other species do when they don’t sleep.

## Combat

| Roll  | How do you feel about having been made as a weapon of war?     |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was made to fight, and so that is what I shall do.           |
|   2   | I take great pride in my combat capabilities.                  |
|   3   | I will use what I have been given to my own advantage.         |
|   4   | My origin as a weapon often makes me feel like I don’t fit in. |
|   5   | I’ve removed what I can of my original capabilities.           |
|   6   | I hate that I was made to hurt people.                         |

**Lock-On:** You gain access to the Aim minor action. When you use this action, select a creature. You gain advantage on all single-target attacks made against that creature until the end of your next turn.

**Optimized:** You are proficient in Athletics.

## Industry

| Roll  | Why were you originally created?                                        |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I was created from a mundane object in an accident.                     |
|   2   | I was created as an experiment.                                         |
|   3   | I was created to do jobs too dangerous for other species.               |
|   4   | I was created to perform repetitive labor.                              |
|   5   | I was created to serve as an employee.                                  |
|   6   | I was created to act as a successor for a retiring master craftsperson. |

**Repurposed:** Your body is an effective weapon all on its own: industrial equipment is incredibly dangerous, if somewhat challenging to use in combat. Create a set of arms using the standard rules which have a gear point total of 2. You are always attuned to them, and they do not count against your attunement limit. These arms have the _wanton_ affix, which does not count against their gear point total. You can modify their affixes using the Craft or Enchant downtime activities.

<div class="inline-box">

**Wanton (arms, common, 1):** Your basic attacks have disadvantage, but deal 1d8 extra damage.

</div>

**Multitool:** Select three pieces of adventuring gear. They are built into your body. You do not need to roll the Supply die in order to access them.
