# Undead

Essence is the spark of life, and, whether by accident or design, it can flow through the corpses of the fallen to bring them back, suspending their life force in a state between life and death. Unlike other creatures, they lack the ability to generate essence of their own, and must instead gather it from living sentient creatures around them.

This creates an uneasy tension between the living and undead: once beloved parts of their communities and lives, the undead must now subsist on the energy of the living. While this process leaves no lasting negative effects, it is a decidedly eerie sensation. At the same time, the undead are fully sentient creatures: capable of suffering and morality just the same as any other species, leaving their role in society a controversial moral topic.

| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1   | I was brought back by someone who didn’t have my best interests in mind. |
|  2   | I was the victim of a magical disaster.                                  |
|  3   | I don’t know, I just woke up again one day.                              |
|  4   | I refused to leave.                                                      |
|  5   | I was brought back to life by my loved ones.                             |

### Features {docsify-ignore}

**Undying:** You have advantage on all skill checks made to maintain your concentration while on Death’s Door, and may heal normally while at 0 life.

**Play Dead:** As a minor action or as a reaction after you are hit by an attack, you may go limp. You are indistinguishable from a dead creature while in this state so long as you do not spend movement or take any actions.

**Empty Shell:** You do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. In fact, you could not even if you tried. Instead, you must consume essence directly to survive, nibbling on the constantly regenerating life force of nearby living creatures or feasting on the escaping souls of the recently dead. Each day that you fail to harvest the soul of a sentient creature, or each month that you fail to consume the soul of a dead creature, you suffer exhaustion as if you had failed to eat.

## Risen

Sometimes other souls inhabit the bodies of those now dead. They come back with their original personalities and memories but a new, unchanging body. At first glance Risen appear as a member of another species. But closer inspection reveals strange and unique characteristics about them: perhaps an unblinking gaze, the lack of a heartbeat, or a youthful face with haunting eyes.

| Roll | How do you feel about your new body?             |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------ |
|  1   | I just wish it was alive.                        |
|  2   | This new body is fine, but totally wrong for me. |
|  3   | Having a new body is incredibly strange.         |
|  4   | Complete indifference.                           |
|  5   | This was my original body.                       |
|  6   | This new form is what I’d always wished to be.   |

Gain the features of another base species of your choice instead of any subspecies features. If you select human, gain their Adaptable and Manual Dexterity features.

## Skeleton

| Roll | How do you feel about being visibly undead?                |
| :--: | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | I am ashamed of how it marks me as different.              |
|  2   | I try to hide it with elaborate outfits.                   |
|  3   | I still try my best to fit in with the species I once was. |
|  4   | I seek to build acceptance of the undead.                  |
|  5   | I embrace it as part of a rebellious aesthetic.            |
|  6   | I love to play spooky pranks on small children.            |

**Blindsight:** Lacking eyeballs, you can no longer see in the usual fashion. Instead, you gain an innate awareness of the 6 tiles around your skull as if you could see in bright light. Within this radius, you are immune to the blinded ailment and light and heavy shroud effects. Outside of this radius, you are treated as if you were suffering from the blinded ailment.

**Detachable:** You may detach and reattach parts of your body at will, controlling them freely so long as they are within 6 tiles of your skull. In combat:

- You can detach or reattach a component by using the Interact minor action, creating a component in an empty tile of your choice within 4 tiles of you. There is no limit on the number of components active at once.
- Each component is 0 tiles in size. Your body stays its original size.
- At the start of your turn, you gain a special pool of movement equal to your movement speed that can only be used to move your components. Each component must be moved separately.
- Your components can be affected by attacks, boons, ground effects and so on in the usual fashion. These effects transfer to you (and vice versa), and you are not affected by multi-target effects multiple times simply because several components (or your body and a component) were within its effect. \* The grappled and grappling status are the exception to this rule. You have disadvantage on Grapple attacks made with your components.
- Whenever you use an action, you may choose to have either yourself or one of your components use it.
- Each component has their own zone of control, which is 1 tile in radius smaller than usual due to their 0 tile size. Ranged attacks made by components only have disadvantage if they are in an enemy zone of control.

**Fetch:** Arms that you use that have the thrown arms affix also gain the benefit of the returning arms affix.

## Spectre

| Roll | What’s holding you to this world?         |
| :--: | ----------------------------------------- |
|  1   | I don’t know, but I can’t leave.          |
|  2   | I need to find out more about how I died. |
|  3   | I have unfinished business.               |
|  4   | I am obsessed with my craft.              |
|  5   | I want to right a wrong.                  |
|  6   | My loved ones.                            |

**Intangible:** You may pass through enemy tiles freely, and you are no longer considered to occupy tiles. As a major action, you may choose to pass through solid objects (but not weapons or effects) until the start of your next turn, gaining one stack of exhaustion when you do so.

**Flickering Connection:** You have resistance to physical damage. After you take physical damage, apply one stack of banished to yourself.

**Fade:** You can no longer use your Play Dead species feature. Instead, as a minor action or as a reaction after you are hit by an attack, you may Fade. When you Fade, apply one stack of banished to yourself.
