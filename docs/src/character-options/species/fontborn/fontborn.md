# Fontborn

Magic breathes life into everything that it touches, and the fonts of power bubble with new forms of it: strange, alien and wonderous.

Often called monsters by the people of the cities and farmlands, some of these creatures have fought against the fonts’ influence and control.
No longer a replaceable, regenerating component of the vast pseudo-organism that is a font of power, the fontborn have become fully sentient people with hopes, dreams and ideals of their own.

Banding together in a brilliant rainbow of diversity, these strange creatures live among the fonts of power themselves, still drawing on their energy for sustenance. Their small communities thrive in harsh and bizarre ailments where other species must fight for their very survival.

| Roll  | How do you feel about your monstrous kin who are still part of the fonts?                      |

|   1   | They are but a mindless part of the whole, no more meaningful than a leaf or fruit.            |
|   2   | I remember the stirrings of sentience from those days, and I'm unsure how to feel.             |
|   3   | There will always be more: the individual is inconsequential.                                  |
|   4   | I try to reach out to those who begin to express themselves.                                   |
|   5   | I struggle to reconcile the need to manage the threats they pose with the monsters' potential. |
|   6   | We need to awaken as many as we can, fighting against the fonts' corrupting power.             |

### Primordial

Freshly forged in the places of great magic, the primordial fontborn form a motley crew, appearing to outsiders as sentient monsters and elementals. While the fontborn cannot reproduce directly, their connection to the fonts of power gives them an unusual talent for resurrection, which they use to continue their kind.

Still nascent and unstable, the fate and form of these creatures is in their own hands. Every fontborn must answer: who and what do I want to become?

### Mutant

Whether they were tragic victims of a magical accident or saved from the brink of death by the strange energy of the fonts, other species end up mutated by the fonts more often than you might expect. Whether they rejoin their families and communities or choose to start fresh among the other fontborn, fontborn mutants forever bear the unique mark of their brush with power.

| Roll | How did you become mutated?                                            |

| 1    | I was subjected to the fonts’ energy as part of a terrible experiment. |

| 3    | I abused consumable magic items.                                       |
| 4    | I was left for dead but saved by the fontborn.                         |
| 5    | I was brought to the fonts to be saved by their energy.                |

| Roll  | How do you feel about your mutation?                                 |
| :---: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | I hate it with every fibre of my being.                              |
|   2   | I feel a quiet shame that I can’t quite explain.                     |
|   3   | It reminds me of my kinship with the outcast and downtrodden.        |
|   4   | It gives me comfort to know that there is no one else truly like me. |
|   5   | I flaunt it, delighting in my strange nature.                        |
|   6   | I embrace what it has to offer, using it to its full potential.      |

While they may share the basic features of the species they once were, every mutant must live with the powers they have gained for the rest of their life.

Gain the features of another base species of your choice instead of any subspecies features. If you select human, gain their Adaptable and Manual Dexterity features.

You may also select feats from their species feats lists.
