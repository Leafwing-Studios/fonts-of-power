# Fae

Descendants of a proud and ancient culture, fairies carry on the old ways in the wild places of the land.
Playful to a fault, they peek curiously at visitors from the safety of a hollow tree or flit excitedly around those they deem safe.

Yet in the face of threats, this playful curiosity quickly turns to a fiercely proud desire to protect their people and homes.
Confronted with the rise of both the thriving cities and the uncontrollable fonts of power, each kindred of fae must decide how to adapt their traditions to a changing world.

| Roll | How do you think your people should adapt?                                                                              |

|  1   | We must drive the threats from our land through fierce warfare.                                                         |
|  2   | Clever tricks and cruel pranks will make our land seem completely inhospitable.                                         |
|  3   | The fonts of power will offer us the protection and power we need to survive, even if it means leaving our land behind. |
|  4   | Carefully selected allies will give us the leverage we need to adapt to this changing world.                            |
|  5   | Through hospitality, I believe it is possible to teach others our ways and live in peace.                               |
|  6   | The free exchange of goods and ideas will bring us both prosperity.                                                     |

| Roll | Why are you leaving your home?                          |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | I need to protect it from a looming threat.             |
|  2   | I want to become a legend in our tales.                 |
|  3   | I’ve been sent on a specific mission from my kindred.   |
