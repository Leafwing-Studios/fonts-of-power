# Slime

Slimes appear to pop into existence spontaneously on the outskirts of fonts of power as not-quite-solid manifestations of elemental energy. Sentient and intelligent, they form societies and cities near fonts of power, searching for and taking in any of their kin that appear.

Playful mimics, slimes readily copy and borrow forms that amuse them, fluidly shifting their form to suit their needs in the moment.
Their cities are vast and wondrous, composed of bubble-like structures attached by a network of pneumatic tubes that shoot the Slimes between the buildings at incredible speeds.

| Roll | What sort of font of power spawned you? |
| :--: | --------------------------------------- |
|  1   | A place of natural power.               |
|  2   | A sacred place.                         |
|  3   | A magical disaster zone.                |
|  4   | A site of a terrible war.               |
|  5   | The ruins of an ancient civilization.   |
|  6   | A powerful magical city.                |

| Roll | How do you feel about newly spawned slimes?                 |

|  1   | They're so cute...                                          |
|  2   | Really, they're such a handful.                             |
|  3   | I prefer to leave the work of raising them to others.       |
|  4   | I was once in their shoes, and I want to repay that debt.   |
|  5   | I love teaching them about the wonderful world around them. |
|  6   | Welcome to the family!                                      |

| Roll | How do you use the flexibility of your body?                              |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | I prefer to stay in my natural slime state when possible.                 |
|  2   | I’m most at home as a slime, but I’m willing to adapt if it seems useful. |
|  3   | I use whatever form is most useful at the moment.                         |
|  4   | I use the form I’m in as a means of self-expression.                      |
|  5   | I love exploring new humanoid forms.                                      |
|  6   | I have a particular affection for a specific humanoid form.               |

### Features {docsify-ignore}

**Formless:** At the end of each of your turns, remove the grappled status from yourself.

**Slimoid:** Your body is a stretchy, pliable, translucent ball of slime. You may shape it as you please, including to carry items, interact with objects or wield arms, but you’re still visibly made out of slime and your total volume stays constant.

While prone, you collapse into a puddle. As a puddle, you may slide under doors and through narrow cracks so long as they are at least half an inch wide. Your gear and other bulky items that you are carrying magically squeeze through with you.

**Uncertain Anatomy:** You do not need to breathe, but must still eat, drink and sleep. Slimes can see, hear and speak as well as a typical human, although how they do so is a closely guarded secret. Items you carry are stored inside your body. They are plainly visible unless covered by clothing or the like.

## Bouncy Slime

**Bounce Back:** At the end of each of your turns, remove an additional stack of each ailment from yourself.

**Elastic Collisions:** Whenever you are hit by a basic attack, you are pushed 1 tile directly away from the source of that attack. The effect of all other non-teleportation forced movement on you is doubled. While moving due to forced movement, whenever you hit a barrier or another, you bounces off at the same angle it came in at, continuing until you run out of movement.

**Sproing:** You are immune to falling damage and moving up or down a height tier costs you only 1 tile of movement, rather than the usual 2 tiles of movement.

## Corrosive Slime

**Digestive Fluids:** At the end of each of your turns, apply one stack of defenseless to each creature you are grappling.

**Omnivory:** Once per rest, you may spend a minute to completely destroy a nonmagical, nonliving object no larger than you are, dissolving it and absorbing any remnants. Each time beyond the first each rest that you use this feature, you must succeed at a difficulty 15 Prowess (Endurance) skill check or suffer one level of exhaustion due to overconsumption.

You do not need to make Endurance skill checks in order to destroy edible objects with this feature.

## Sticky Slime

**Combat Glue:** You have advantage on skill checks made to maintain your grapple.

**Stuck to the Ground:** If you did not spend movement during your last turn, the effects of forced movement against you are halved.

**Tactical Adhesive:** You do not need to make Athletics skill checks to climb or stay attached to any surface. You no longer reset to the height tier of the tile you are standing on at the end of your turn.
