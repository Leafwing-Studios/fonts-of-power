# Reclaimer

Indiscriminate lovers of junk and treasure, the Reclaimers follow in the wake of the great events of the fonts: chasing after clues, preserving memories and picking up the artifacts left behind.
Uniquely resilient to the toxic effects of essence overload, they serve as scholars, archaeologists and adventurers, proudly showcasing their latest finds.

Reclaimers appear short and scrawny, bedecked in assorted piles of scavenged gear. To many, their true appearance remains a mystery, hidden underneath dazzling carapaces of found treasures.
But those who have met one remember their glowing eyes: peeking out curiously from their elaborate mobile homes.
The color of these eyes portrays their favorite sort of magical item, drawn to the memories that they hold.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Those almost immediately forgotten, attached to literal junk.                         |
| 2    | The memories of pride and greed, tied to the objects that shine boastfully.           |
| 3    | Practical, earnest memories of developed skills, hard-won with honest tools.          |
| 4    | The valuable teachings, deliberately committed to memory, found in books and scrolls. |
| 5    | Memories of strife and conflict, bound up in the objects that defined history.        |
| 6    | Those that taste of love and home, created in the quiet, fond moments.                |

| Roll | Why do you conceal your body with gear?                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 2    | There's so much to appreciate, so why not wear more?            |
| 3    | Wearing all this equipment makes me feel connected to the past. |
| 4    | It makes me feel safer to be surrounded like this.              |
| 5    | This is a time-honored cultural tradition.                      |
| 6    | I like the air of mystery it brings.                            |
