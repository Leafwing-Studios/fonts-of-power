# Contributing to *Fonts of Power*

## Prelude

*Fonts of Power* is an in-development game,
intended for commercial release and fully controlled by *Leafwing Studios*.

As such, development is intended to be done almost completely by members of the *Leafwing* team.
However, if you have a quick typo / bug / code quality fix, feel free to contribute :)

For questions of game design, please come discuss the game in one of the design channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5nqXVJ7)!

By submitting a PR, you agree to assign all intellectual property to *Leafwing Studios* in the event that the PR is accepted,
and waive all corresponding [moral rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights), although we will do our best to credit such contributions!

## Licensing

This code, the rules, and all assets are proprietary, and are shown here under a [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) model.
However, feel free to browse, learn from and borrow small snippets from the code base.

If there's a complex piece of functionality that would be helpful to you in your project, please file an issue!
*Leafwing Studios* deeply believes in the value of open-source, and core game components are frequently spun off into MIT + Apache licenced standalone projects.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue with an appropriate template.
2. Check out the latest `main` commit in Git.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Create a new pull request with an appropriate template. Use "Closes #X" in your text body to automatically close out issues.
5. Flesh out the changes in the pull request. Try to clean up any FOLLOWUPs that interact with your changes.
Use clear commit messages and separate out each type of change into a new commit. Avoid unrelated changes.
