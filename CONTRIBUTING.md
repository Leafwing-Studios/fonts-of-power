# Contributing to *Fonts of Power*

## Prelude

*Fonts of Power* is an in-development game,
intended for commercial release and fully controlled by *Leafwing Studios*.

As such, these directions are intended for members of the *Leafwing* team.
PRs made are accepted only with the understanding that all intellectual property is assigned to *Leafwing Studios*,
but if you have a quick typo / bug / code quality fix, feel free to contribute :)

For questions of game design, please come discuss the game in one of the design channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5nqXVJ7)!

## Workflow

1. Open an issue with an appropriate template.
2. Check out the latest `master` commit in Git.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Mark the work that needs to be done with "TODO", and follow-up work created with "FOLLOWUP" directly in the docs / code.
5. Create a new pull request with an appropriate template. Use "Closes #X" in your text body to automatically close out issues.
6. Flesh out the changes in the pull request. Try to clean up any FOLLOWUPs that interact with your changes.
Use clear commit messages and separate out each type of change into a new commit. Avoid unrelated changes.
7. Verify that all TODOs are removed from the code-base before merging.
