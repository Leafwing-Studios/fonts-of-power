# Contributing to *Fonts of Power*

## Prelude

*Fonts of Power* is an in-development game,
intended for commercial release and fully controlled by *Leafwing Studios*.

As such, development is intended to be done almost completely by members of the *Leafwing* team.
However, if you have a quick typo / bug / code quality fix, feel free to contribute and we'll do our best to respond constructively and provide appropriate credit :)

For questions of game design, please come discuss the game in one of the design channels on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5nqXVJ7)!

## IP Assignment

We deeply appreciate fan feedback and fixes.
But, as this is not an open-source project, final creative control and intellectual property remains with *Leafwing Studios*.

By creating an issue, submitting a PR, or otherwise providing suggestions to the team, you agree to assign all intellectual property (including copyright) to *Leafwing Studios* in the event that the suggestion made or a similar suggestion is accepted or implemented.
In addition, you agree to waive all corresponding [moral rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights), and grant a patent license per the terms of Section 3 of the [Apache-2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Licensing

This code, the rules, and all assets are proprietary, and are shown here under a [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) model.
However, feel free to browse, learn from and borrow small snippets from the code base.

If there's a complex piece of functionality that would be helpful to you in your project, please file an issue!
*Leafwing Studios* deeply believes in the value of open-source, and core game components are frequently spun off into MIT + Apache licenced standalone projects.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue with an appropriate template.
2. Check out the latest `main` commit in Git.
3. Create a new branch.
4. Create a new pull request with an appropriate template. Use "Closes #X" in your text body to automatically close out issue #X.
5. Flesh out the changes in the pull request. Try to clean up any FOLLOWUPs that interact with your changes.
Use clear commit messages and separate out each type of change into a new commit. Avoid unrelated changes.
