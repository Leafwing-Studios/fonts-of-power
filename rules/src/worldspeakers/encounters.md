## Motivations

See [Monster Motivations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KV15USBZ8DOAUen25lFb1FthHYcGYEkDrIpvTvHP8Yw/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet for goals from monsters.

Also consider current narrative arc, quests and goals players have.

## Arena design

1. Define the fight. For each danger level, choose one of the following arena options. You can select the same option more than once:
   1. **Overpowered:** Increase the proficiency bonus of the monsters by 1.
      1. This also effects their affixes, powers, and attributes as described below.
   2. **Uneven Odds:**Add another turn worth of monsters for every four players, rounded down.
      1. Action economy is extremely powerful: if you have fewer than four players, select this multiple times to achieve the desired effect.
   3. **Unending Waves:** Every X rounds, spawn another standard monster.
      1. TODO: playtest to determine X.
      2. Can reduce frequency of waves to increase number of monsters at once.
      3. Can only be selected if an alternate victory condition is enabled.
   4. **Environmental Adaptation:** Add an arena modifier or recurring vantage that the monsters are well-adapted to.
      1. Affix and ability synergy.
      2. Knowledge of the mechanics.
   5. **Unfair Advantage:** The monsters start in a tactically advantageous position.
      1. Hidden creatures.
      2. At a significant height advantage.
      3. Holding a chokepoint.
      4. Controlling a powerful vantage.
      5. Protected by traps or dangerous terrain.
      6. Swap this: pick another two modifiers.
   6. **Terrible Start:** The players start in a tactically terrible position.
      1. In a chokepoint.
      2. In or surrounded by difficult or dangerous terrain.
      3. Surrounded on all sides.
      4. The players are separated.
      5. Swap this: pick another two modifiers.
   7. **Tactical Goal:** Add a tactical goal for the players to focus on.
      1. **Chase:** Players must stop a monster from escaping.
         1. The monster escapes from the fight once it reaches a dedicated escape zone.
      2. **Escape:** Players win by escaping the fight.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
         2. Players can escape from the fight if they reach a designated escape zone.
      3. **Protect:** Players must protect a non-combatant.
      4. **Rescue:** Players must rescue a non-combatant.
      5. **Survive:** Players win if they survive until 5 rounds have elapsed.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
      6. **Defend:** Map contains a powerful monster-only interactable that can turn the tides of the fight.
      7. **Assault:** Map contains a powerful player-only interactable that can turn the tides of the fight.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
      8. **Ringleader:** Players win if they defeat a particular standard monster.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.

      10. **Loot:** Players win if they get a specific item, then escape.
          1. Pick another modifier.
2. Design basic outline of arena.
   1. Draw boundaries.
   2. Add the zones of interest required for the goal.
   3. Designate starting zones for each side.
      1. Each should be about 4 - 10 tiles in size.
3. Add interest.
   1. Cover.
   2. Difficult or dangerous terrain.
   3. Verticality.
   4. Unusual connectivity.
      1. Crawl-throughs.
      2. Trap doors.
      3. Portals.
      4. Ladders.
      5. Zip-lines and slides.
      6. Narrow gaps.
      7. Water-only passageways.
   5. Interactable vantages.
   6. Lighting.
   7. Arena modifiers.
   8. Triggered events that change the fight over time.

## Monster Building

1. Select a total number of turns: should be within 1 of the players.
   1. Divide these turns across the monsters in the combat.
2. Set life totals: 25 * turns per round.
3. Set proficiency bonus to within 1 of the players.
4. Set attributes: total should be 5 + 2 * proficiency bonus.
   1. Total pool is increased
5. Build or choose base arms and armor.
   1. One set of arms, one set of armor.
6. Choose affixes such that enchantment point total is equal to 2 * proficiency bonus.
   1. These can be discovered by the players if they win!
   2. Consider drawing from font's pool of affixes.
   3. Some affixes are monster-only: they don't make sense or are broken on players and are excluded from the pool players can gain.
7. Build or choose 3 powers. Can replace one power for an extra set of arms.
   1. Same balance as player powers: 1 essence = 1 AP.
   2. Try to avoid spending more than 3 essence per turn on average to limit burst.
