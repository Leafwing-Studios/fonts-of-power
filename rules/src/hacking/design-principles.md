# Design Principles

## Vision

*Fonts of Power* is a tactical combat RPG that makes exploring the world fun, deep and challenging.

## Goals

### Combat

1. Combat is genuinely fun and interesting.
2. Combat is flexible and powerful enough to represent rich, high-tension scenarios.

### Exploration

## Sacrifices

The following flaws and sacrifices are made willingly.

### General

1. High learning curve.
2. 2+ hour sessions needed.
3. Additional tooling beyond the basic pen-and-paper is needed to play the game comfortably.
4. Realism is poor: this is not a simulationist system.

### Combat

1. Significant learning curve.
2. Effect and status tracking can be hard.
3. High customization complexity in service of skill expression.
4. There will be a gap between the best and worst builds in service of skill expression.
5. Players must think about the state of combat, rather than following a routine.

### Exploration

1. Many existing fantasy tropes play poorly with the guilt-free enjoyment of battle and exploration.
2. Campaigns should be very combat-heavy, and focused on adventurers who venture bravely forth.

### GMs

1. Bending the rules will feel unfair, as it negates important choices.
2. Significant thought is needed to create monsters and combat encounters.
3. Settings must contain interesting, dangerous, magical places for adventurers to go.

### Designers

1. More careful balancing is needed, since the GM can't freely fudge life totals on the fly.
