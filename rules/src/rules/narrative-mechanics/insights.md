# Insights

From time to time, the players may find themselves floundering as they struggle to put together the pieces of the worldspeakerâ€™s puzzle.

However, the characters themselves might have an intuition about what to do next. When this happens, the player characters, using the rules for group skill checks, can make a Focus (Insight) skill check to try to make a logical deduction or lucky hunch, coming upon an **insight** of their own, supplied by the worldspeaker.

The worldspeaker should use the table below as a guide for the quality of information you might gain based on your results.

| Focus (Insight) check result | Quality of Insight                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 5                            | Something incredibly obvious.       |
| 10                           | A straightforward deduction.        |
| 15                           | A few clues come together.          |
| 20                           | A useful but unsubstantiated hunch. |
| 25                           | A great feat of logical deduction.  |
