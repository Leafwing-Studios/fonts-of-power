# Deals and Ideals

When one character wants something of another, a **deal** must be struck.
There are four phases in the process of making deals:

1. **Probing:** each side learns more about the other's needs, capabilities and values.
2. **Pitch:** the **active party** proposes a deal, and the **reactive party** evaluates the deal.
3. **Haggling:** the reactive party responds to the deal. Counteroffers and persuasion occurs until either the deal is made or someone walks away.
4. **Completion:** the active party attempts to complete the deal, increasing or decreasing the loyalty of the reactive party based on their success.

## Probing

You'll have much better luck convincing others to work with you if you understand their values and needs.

As you interact with the other party, make two skill checks:

- A difficulty 15 Focus (Insight) skill check to learn their exact loyalty towards you.
If your skill check result is at least 5, you learn whether their loyalty is positive, negative or 0.
- A difficulty 20 Focus (Humanities) skill check to learn their exact ideals.
If your skill check result is at least 10, you learn their highest and lowest ideal (the worldspeaker chooses freely in the case of a tie).

## Pitch

In this stage, the active party (usually the player characters) proposes a specific deal: if the other party does X, they will do Y in return.

NPCs evaluate deals by adding together five factors to produce an **interest score**:

1. Their **loyalty** to the active party.
   1. This ranges from -5 to 5, based on how much they like and trust the active party.
   2. The loyalty of most NPCs begins at 0.
2. The **payoff** of the deal: what the reactive party has to gain from the deal relative to what they have to lose.
   1. This ranges from -2 to +2 according to the table below.
3. The **plausibility** of the deal: how likely they feel the plan is to succeed.
   1. This ranges from -2 to +2 according to the table below.
4. The **moral benefit** of the deal, viewed through the lens of their ideals.
   1. If the deal significantly advances the values of at least one ideal, add their highest corresponding ideal.
5. The **moral harm** of the deal, viewed through the lens of their ideals.
   1. If the deal significantly conflicts with the values of at least one ideal, add their highest corresponding ideal.

| Modifier | Payoff                                                           | Plausibility                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| -2       | The benefit of success is much less than the cost of failure.    | Success is dramatically less likely than failure. |
| -1       | The benefit of success is less than the cost of failure.         | Success is less likely than failure.              |
| 0        | The benefit of success is about the same as the cost of failure. | Success and failure are about equally likely.     |
| 1        | The benefit of success is greater than the cost of failure.      | Success is more likely than failure.              |
| 2        | The benefit of success is much greater than the cost of failure. | Success is dramatically more likely than failure. |

The worldspeaker alone decides the payoff, plausibility and morality of the deal, based on the NPC’s unique perspective and needs.
The final interest score, but not the constituent values, is public information.

Deals can be offered by any character, but player characters always choose freely whether to accept or reject a deal.

**Moral dilemmas**

Many deals have moral factors that weigh both for and against them.
For example, you may be attempting to convince a local miner to give you explosives that you can use to destroy the machinery that belongs to the oppressive owner of the mine who’s forcing orphans to work for him.
This would be a moral benefit from the perspective of Equality and Liberty, but a moral harm from the perspective of Harmony and Progress.

Suppose that the miner’s ideals are \[4,3,2,1,0\] in the standard alphabetical order.
The value of 4 in Equality is higher than his value of 1 in Liberty, so we add 4 to the morality of the deal.
However, he has a value of 3 in Harmony (which is higher than his value of 1 in Progress), so we subtract 3 from the morality of the deal. The final morality assessment is thus 1, reflecting his mixed feelings about the righteousness of the plan.

### Deception

Of course, the deal you propose doesn't have to be *entirely* truthful.
You may attempt to lie to the reactive party, evaluating your success based on the results of your Presence (Charm) skill check.
The difficulty of this skill check depends on how serious of a lie you are making:

- **10:** You are lying about your motivations.
- **15:** You are lying about a small detail.
- **20:** You are lying about or omitting an important fact.
- **25:** Your story bears no resemblance to the underlying truth.
- **30:** The story is entirely unbelievable.

If you fail, the other party senses something is off and walks away from the deal.
If you fail by 5 or more, the party is certain that you are lying and walks away from the deal.
Their loyalty towards you is decreased by 1.

Helping with this skill checks requires passing a difficulty 20 Presence (Charm) skill check.

## Haggling

Now that we've evaluated the deal, it's time for the reactive party to respond to the offer:

- **Interest score below -3:** The reactive party is insulted by the terrible offer, and walks away. Their loyalty towards you is decreased by 1..
- **Interest score between -3 and 0:** The reactive party is willing to renegotiate.
  - The active party may Call in a Favor, attempt to use Salesmanship, or make a Moral Appeal.
  - As a group, you may only use each option once per pitch.
  - Helping with these skill checks requires passing a difficulty 20 skill check of the same type.
  - Go back to the Pitch phase if the reactive party cannot be persuaded: either party can propose a new deal.
- **Interest score of +1:** The reactive party accepts the deal, viewing it as fair.
- **Interest score greater than +1:** The reactive party accepts the deal, thrilled with the bargain they got. Increase their loyalty by 1.

### Call in a Favor

If the party desperately needs a favor, they can sacrifice the loyalty they have earned.

Bid any number of points of loyalty, up to the current (positive) value of loyalty that the NPC has.
Each point of loyalty they spend increases the interest score by 1, stacking with the original bonus due to their loyalty.

After the deal is accepted, this loyalty is permanently lost and must be rebuilt.

### Salesmanship

Persuade the reactive party about how beneficial the deal would be for them.
Make a Presence (Charm) skill check, and increase the reactive party’s perception of the payoff or plausibility of the deal by 1 point for every 10 points of your skill check result, rounded down.
Like always, payoff and plausibility are capped at +2.

If your skill check result is 10 or less, the other party walks away from the deal.

### Moral Appeal

Attempt to temporarily change the reactive party's ideals for the purposes of assessing the deal, causing them to either care more strongly about the moral benefits of the task, or overlook any moral questionability.

Make a Presence (Guidance) skill check.
If you succeed, temporarily increase or decrease the reactive party's value of an ideal by 1 for every 10 points of your skill check result for this pitch.

Characters can spot insincere moral arguments: the character making the check has advantage on this skill check if their personal value for that ideal is more extreme than the new value for the NPC’s ideal, and disadvantage if it is less extreme.

If your skill check result is 10 or less, the other party walks away from the deal.

## Completion

With a deal made, it's now up to the active party (usually an enterprising band of adventurers) to complete their half of the deal.
Depending on how this goes, this affects the reactive party's loyalty towards them:

- **Serious failure:** Decrease loyalty by 2.
- **Failure:** Decrease loyalty by 1.
- **Success** Increase loyalty by 1.
- **Serious success:** Increase loyalty by 2.

More important and challenging tasks have higher stakes, and result in larger loyalty swings.
Abandoning a task for an extended period (particularly without any communication) will typically be viewed as having failed a task, causing a drop in loyalty.
If the task is later completed, gain loyalty in the normal fashion, cancelling out the loss due to abandoning the task.

At the worldspeaker's discretion, other actions in the world can result in changes to the loyalty of creatures who it affected.
