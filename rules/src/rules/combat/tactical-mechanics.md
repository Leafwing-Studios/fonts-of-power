# Tactical Mechanics

## Boons

**Boons** are benefits that you grant other creatures (typically your allies) that make them more effective in combat.
The distinction mostly matters for effects which improve your boons, such as the supportive or encouraging talents.
If a power has both positive and negative effects, it still counts as a boon.

Effects which qualify as a boon include but are not limited to:

- granting absorption
- granting resistance or immunity to damage
- granting advantage on attacks
- causing attacks made against them to have disadvantage
- removing harmful conditions, such as with the Treat or Break Grapple action
- granting additional movement
- turning them invisible
- granting them the benefit of an action
- blocking for them
- allowing them to shift

Effects which do not, on their own, qualify as a boon include:

- applying forced movement
- replacing ailments or afflictions

## Concentration

Many classes (particularly Devout, Shamans, Soulbinders and Weavers) use **concentration** as a mechanic in order to maintain control over ongoing effects. Whenever you lose life while you are concentrating on an effect, you must pass a difficulty 15 Endurance **concentration check** to maintain your concentration or the effect ends.
If you lost life due to physical damage, you must make a Prowess (Endurance) skill check.
If it was elemental damage make a Focus (Endurance) skill check instead.

If the damage was a mixture of physical and elemental damage, the attribute used depends on the majority of damage (Prowess in the case of a tie).
As a reminder, damage taken that is prevented by the Block reaction or absorption does not cause you to lose life.

If you are concentrating on several effects at once, make only one skill check each time you lose life; you lose concentration on all of them if you fail.

## Creature Sizes

The size of creatures is specified as the number of tiles they take up.
By default, all player characters take up 1 tile.
Large creatures such as horses may take up two tiles, and particularly huge creatures may take up three or four tiles, or even more!
If a number of tiles that a unit is said to take up is inconvenient for your choice of battle grid, feel free to adjust the number of tiles slightly to make it fit comfortably.
For example, a creature that takes up seven tiles is very convenient on a hexagonal grid and terrible on a square grid.

For creatures that are not radially symmetric on your chosen grid (such as a cow that takes up two tiles), your orientation is fixed as you move laterally. You may **change your orientation** freely by spending one tile of movement.

Range is always calculated using the shortest path between the tiles that are occupied by the creatures in question. As a result, if two creatures are adjacent, they can always make melee attacks against each other, no matter how large they are.

Grapple attacks made against creatures larger than you have disadvantage, as do those made to grapple creatures less than a quarter your size.
Creatures cannot make Grapple attacks against creatures which are more than four times their size.

As a special case, particularly small creatures, such as faeries, are said to take up **zero tiles.** This means:

- They may occupy and pass through tiles that contain other creatures and vice versa.
- Their zone of control is limited to the tile that they are in. If their zone of control is extended, such as by the reach arms affix, the final radius is 1 tile smaller than usual.
- They can only Grapple or Shove creatures that are one tile in size.

## Forced Movement

Many effects, such as shoving an enemy or getting knocked back by a giant blast of wind, move creatures against their will. This is known as **forced movement.**

If a creature is **pushed away,** they travel along the line between you and them away from you, ending in the nearest empty tile to their computed location. If they are **pulled towards** you, they travel along that same line, but move towards your current position. Unless otherwise stated, creatures cannot be moved into occupied tiles by forced movement.

Whenever a creature would be forcibly moved into an occupied tile, they are instead placed in the nearest empty tile instead. Unless a creature is moved by teleportation, attempt to maintain the direction of movement as best as possible while doing so. If the final location of a creature is ever ambiguous, the creature that applied the forced movement chooses between the viable options.

Forced movement can provoke attacks of opportunity.

Modifiers to the strength of forced movement stack additively.

### Teleportation

**Teleportation** is a special kind of forced movement, which moves you directly from one tile to another. Teleportation is different from ordinary forced movement in the following ways:

- it ignores any tile effects that you would cross over
- the intervening tiles do not need to be passable
- distance is measured directly, rather than based on the path taken

Like all forced movement, you can still teleport and be teleported while you have the rooted ailment, as you are not spending movement.
Similarly, you can still teleport and be teleported while you are grappled (or grappling) and bring the creature(s) you are grappling with you, dividing the distance travelled between you.

## Shifts

Various effects allow you to carefully move across the battlefield.
When you shift, you may move into an adjacent empty tile of your choice.
This does not cost movement and never provokes attacks of opportunity.
The creature who is shifting controls where they move, and may choose not to move at all.

If it is not your turn when you shift, trigger any tile effects of the tile that you shifted out of.
You can only trigger a particular tile effect once per turn in this way.

Shifting is not forced movement. You can still shift even when you cannot spend movement (such as due to the grappled / grappling status or the rooted ailment).
If you are part of a grappling graph when you shift, the distance to each creature that you are connected to must remain within their respective zone of control.
