# Human

Enterprising to a fault, humans are a cosmopolitan species, taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities and challenges created by the fonts of power to build globe-spanning trade networks and thriving hub cities. They are natural craftspeople, turning raw materials into useful products and adapting rapidly to any new technology or challenge that might be thrown their way.

The diversity of the human species is its greatest strength: no two are quite the same, each with their own unique talents and perspectives.
