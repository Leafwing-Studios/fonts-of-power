# Combat Power Budgets

These guidelines are intended to allow you to quickly and easily create and evaluate new abilities.

Action points are the fundamental currency of combat: all other features are measured with respect to those.

Effects are less expensive if they are:

- conditional
  - effects that play off of vantages
    - hiding
  - effects that require coordination
    - attacks of opportunity
  - positional requirements
    - short-ranged effects
    - area-of-effect
- risky
  - melee combatants
- tactically counterable
  - absorption
  - afflictions
  - ailments
  - neutral vantages
- delayed
  - afflictions
- inefficient
  - Runeseeker's "spells are more expensive" option
- unreliable
  - roll to hit
  - random effects

Afflictions will do more damage over the long run, but they're a) avoidable b) not instant c) can be mitigated with

Note that you must roll to hit to apply damage, but absorption is guaranteed.
However, absorption can be wasted.

## Buffs and debuffs

1 AP attacks or 1 AP of boons allows you to:

- one stack of an ailment
- being knocked prone
- having to spend 1 AP to remove, go around or fix something
- move a creature

The following effects are about half that powerful:

- disadvantage or advantage on basic or special attacks

## Vantages

The following vantages are about equally strong to create:

- heavily shrouded
- height tier 1
- 1 edge of wall
