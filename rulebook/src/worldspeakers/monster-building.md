# Building Monsters

## Monster Attributes

Like players, monsters have the following attributes:

1. Life
2. Essence
3. Attributes
4. Skill proficiency (3)
5. Proficiency bonus
6. Basic attack and special attack bonus
7. Basic defense and special defense

They are primarily defined by:

1. Features
2. Powers
3. Arms and armor
4. Motivation
5. Spell card

However monsters do not have:

1. Exhaustion
2. Access to the Essence Tap feature
3. Death's door(?)
4. Exploration-focused powers or features
5. Ideals

## Scaling monsters

Each monster can scale in two ways:

1. Turns per round (scales with number of players to produce a balanced action economy)
2. Tier (scales with player proficiency bonus to keep parity in features and statistics)

Scaling turns per round increases:

1. The number of turns taken in each round
2. Max life (?)
3. The number of powers known (2 + 1/2 turns per round)

It may also unlock a spell card!

Scaling tier is somewhat more complex, increasing:

1. Attributes (5 + tier)
2. Proficiency bonus (tier)
3. Number of features (tier)
4. Gear point total on arms and armor (2 * tier)

## Spell Cards

Spell cards are powerful, once-per-fight effects.
Each monster has an associated spell-card: it unlocks only if the number of turns per round is greater than half the number of players.

## Monstrous Features

Montstrous features work just like player features, and are intended to be equivalent power to feats and non-capstone class features.

Many simple options exist, and when designing a monster, you should generally be quite mindful of the complexity budget.
Stick to one or two interesting and self-synergistic ideas about how a monster will fight.

Unlike for players, monster have access to negative features.
When a negative feature is taken, the monster may take an additional feature to compensate.

## Monstrous Powers

These work just like players.
