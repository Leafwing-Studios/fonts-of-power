# Affixes

This section is very WIP.

You are encouraged to hand out learnable affixes as loot.
You give the players the card, and they now know the affix.
Alternatly, you can instead give out a source of knowledge for the affix that you want them to learn.

## Affix sources of knowledge

When determining lists of affixes for teachers and books, pick 3-6 affixes for them to know.
If you are unsure of what to pick, you can always draw random affixes from the learnable affix pool.

## Unique affixes

Unique affixes exist so that you can do "affixes as keys", and have other special quest rewards.
The canonical pupose is having a special boss monster (for example, Dracula) that can only be killed with a special weapon.
In order to kill the boss, the party must first go on a sidequest to mount doom to imbue their weapons with the special "can kill dracula" affix, before they take on the boss.

By default, the unique affix pool is empty, but you may populate it with as many affixes as you wish, with the following restrictions:
- Unique affixes cannot provide any general purpose combat power, such as increased damage or status effects. Instead, they should have a specific purpose or use in mind.
- Unique affixes should be bounded to that use, ideally contained within a single module or adventure. Outside of its intended use within that module or adventure, the players should have little reason to keep it around.
- You may allow unique affixes to be applied without needing the use of the Enchant downtime activity.
- You are encouraged to make unique affixes cost 0 gear points, to make it easier for players to slot them onto their existing arms and armor, although this is not required.
- Affixes which do not start in the unique pool (i.e. the learnable affixes) cannot be moved into the unique affix pool for any reason.

Examples:
- Special weaknesses, such as requiring that a weapon be dipped in the lava of Mount Doom before the weapon can kill Dracula
- Negating the negative effects of a font, such as needing imbued wooden masks to poisonous gasses
- Imbuing weapons with holy light before they can harm shadow demons
- Dipping one's sword in a pool of water in one part of a dungeon, before using that sword to open a door in another part of the dungeon
- Gaining the blessing of a local major spirit, resulting in +20d6 damage against all dark spritis, and reducing damage from dark spirits by 50 (but useless against other enemy types)
