1. Figure out why the combat is occurring.
2. Design an arena.
3. Build some monsters.
4. Fight!

## Motivations

See [Monster Motivations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KV15USBZ8DOAUen25lFb1FthHYcGYEkDrIpvTvHP8Yw/edit#gid=0) spreadsheet for goals from monsters.

Also consider current narrative arc, quests and goals players have.

## Arena design

1. Define the fight. For each danger level, choose one of the following arena options. You can select the same option more than once:
   1. **Overpowered:** Increase the proficiency bonus of the monsters by 1.
      1. This also effects their affixes, powers, and attributes as described below.
   2. **Uneven Odds:**Add another turn worth of monsters for every four players, rounded down.
      1. Action economy is extremely powerful: if you have fewer than four players, select this multiple times to achieve the desired effect.
   3. **Unending Waves:** Every X rounds, spawn another standard monster.
      1. TODO: playtest to determine X.
      2. Can reduce frequency of waves to increase number of monsters at once.
      3. Can only be selected if an alternate victory condition is enabled.
   4. **Environmental Adaptation:** Add an arena modifier or recurring vantage that the monsters are well-adapted to.
      1. Affix and ability synergy.
      2. Knowledge of the mechanics.
   5. **Unfair Advantage:** The monsters start in a tactically advantageous position.
      1. Hidden creatures.
      2. At a significant height advantage.
      3. Holding a chokepoint.
      4. Controlling a powerful vantage.
      5. Protected by traps or dangerous terrain.
      6. Swap this: pick another two modifiers.
   6. **Terrible Start:** The players start in a tactically terrible position.
      1. In a chokepoint.
      2. In or surrounded by difficult or dangerous terrain.
      3. Surrounded on all sides.
      4. The players are separated.
      5. Swap this: pick another two modifiers.
   7. **Tactical Goal:** Add a tactical goal for the players to focus on.
      1. **Chase:** Players must stop a monster from escaping.
         1. The monster escapes from the fight once it reaches a dedicated escape zone.
      2. **Escape:** Players win by escaping the fight.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
         2. Players can escape from the fight if they reach a designated escape zone.
      3. **Protect:** Players must protect a non-combatant.
      4. **Rescue:** Players must rescue a non-combatant.
      5. **Survive:** Players win if they survive until 5 rounds have elapsed.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
      6. **Defend:** Map contains a powerful monster-only interactable that can turn the tides of the fight.
      7. **Assault:** Map contains a powerful player-only interactable that can turn the tides of the fight.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
      8. **Ringleader:** Players win if they defeat a particular standard monster.
         1. Pick another two modifiers.
      9. **Head Honcho:** Players win if they defeat a particular boss monster.
      10. **Loot:** Players win if they get a specific item, then escape.
          1. Pick another modifier.
2. Design basic outline of arena.
   1. Draw boundaries.
   2. Add the zones of interest required for the goal.
   3. Designate starting zones for each side.
      1. Each should be about 4 - 10 tiles in size.
3. Add interest.
   1. Cover.
   2. Difficult or dangerous terrain.
   3. Verticality.
   4. Unusual connectivity.
      1. Crawl-throughs.
      2. Trap doors.
      3. Portals.
      4. Ladders.
      5. Zip-lines and slides.
      6. Narrow gaps.
      7. Water-only passageways.
   5. Interactable vantages.
   6. Lighting.
   7. Arena modifiers.
   8. Triggered events that change the fight over time.
      1. Design a clear trigger and clear effect.

## Selecting monsters

Select a group of monsters for the players to fight.
For rules on how to make your own monsters, see [monster building](monster-building.md).

Choose your monsters based on the narrative experience you want to create, freely reflavoring premade monsters to match your needs.
Then, set the difficulty of the fight by selecting both the tier of each monster and the total number of turns of the enemy group.

Groups of monsters scale in two ways:

1. Tier: increased complexity and power
2. Turns: improved action economy and base life

The tier of the monsters should generally increase as the players level up: a tier equal to the players' proficiency bonus is considered fair.
The number of turns that a monster has should generally increase as the party size: turns equal to the number of players is considered fair.

Remember that powerful monsters can take more than one turn per round: this is a great way to handle leaders and boss monsters.

Note that a "genuinely fair" fight is very hard by the standards of TTRPGs!
If the worldspeaker is playing to win, the party should expect to be defeated about half of the time.
While a defeat does not and should not always mean a full party wipe, this level of intensity can be too high for many parties.
Work with your table to find a level of difficulty that matches what they're looking for!
In some campaigns, a "realistic" approach to combat encounter difficulty can be great for immersion and encourage problem solving:
sure that eldritch god would kill your level 1 party immediately, I hope you have a better plan that to hit it.

While you generally want to be within a point or two of the party for both tier and number of turns,
reducing tier while increasing the number of turns (or vice versa) can make for a memorable combat experience once in a while.
