# Trinkets

For a more in-depth discussion of trinkets, their intended uses, and how to create them, check out the hacking guide.
In general, rules for designing custom items are handled there.
However, trinkets were designed to be flexible so that worldspeakers can add interesting loot to give to players, 
and to create opportunities for custom dungeon keys, quest items, special weaknesses, maguffins, etc.

For example, you might want to create:
- Interesting (or silly!) magical items to give to the players
- Unique dungeon keys or puzzle elements
- Special "kryptonite" weaknesses for dungeon bosses
- Magical artifacts that various groups are fighting over

What follows is a basic overview of how you can use trinkets for dungeon design and world building.
There are three main categories:
1. Dungeon-specific non-combat items
2. Dungeon-specific combat items
3. Non-combat exploration items ("normal" trinkets fall into this category)

## Dungeon-specific non-combat items: magic keys

Unlike normal trinkets, trinkets in this category mostly serve to be used within the scope of a single dungeon or adventure.
Their uses are generally specific and tightly scoped, though they may see general use after the dungeon is over.

For example:
- A magical key that can open certain doors in the dungeon
- A metal spigot that spews out water constantly. This might be used to fill a reservoir as part of a puzzle.
- A talking book that helps guide the players through rooms, or gives explanation about the background of the area.
- A pair of spectacles that lets the players tell friends from enemies in disguise

These can add a lot of richness and depth to your dungeons and scenes, so do make full use of them!
From a balance perspective, be careful to make sure their power level isn't too high outside of the situation they were designed for.
For example, an electric baton that stuns guards can be very fun for a stealth section,
but being able to one-hit KO any creature with a spinal cord might cause issues in future combats.

## Dungeon-specific combat items: how to kill Dracula

It is often desirable to make enemies or bosses that have to be dealt with in a specific way.
This can add a unique flair to fights, and turn otherwise boring combats into their own mini-puzzles.
Trinkets are the intended system to enable this.

A classic example: fighting Dracula.
Dracula is a vampire, so he can't be killed by normal means.
Instead, the players must get his health down to zero, the stake him in the heart.
If you were designing Dracula's castle, you might want to hide a "wooden stake" item somewhere in the dungeon.
The players have to find it, then go confront the big man.
To enable this, simply make the wooden stake a trinket who's only ability is "can kill dracula once he's down to 1 health".

Some other examples of combat trinkets:
- Items which stun, weaken or finish off bosses
- Items which can enrage an enemy to bait certain attacks
- Items which can remotely control vantages

The main rule when creating these is that their power should be **very specific** and **very limited**.
Although this is talked about more in the hacking guide, generically useful combat trinkets would cause balance problems.
Ideally, these trinkets are only used for a *single* fight or dungeon, after which they can be discarded (or sold to a museum).
Another option is to turn the specific combat trinket into a standard non-combat one after its combat duty is fulfilled.
(See the next section for details.)

As a final piece of food for thought, you can do this with special affixes too :).
Same rules apply.

## Non-combat exploration items: handy gizmos

This category covers all the "normal" prebuild trinkets that players can find.
Though trinkets can technically be used in combat, trinkets are non-combat items by design.
They should primarily be used in exploration scenes to solve puzzles, get past obstacles, or interact with NPCs.
Although the exact design and limitations of trinkets are talked about in more detail in the hacking guide,
there is room to make custom magic items in this space.
When making your own magic items, follow the example set by the existing trinkets for balance guidance.
