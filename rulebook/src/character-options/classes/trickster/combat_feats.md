# Combat Feats

## Disappearing Act

**Effects:** Whenever you successfully use the Hide action, you may become invisible until the start of your next turn. The invisibility breaks immediately after making an attack.

## Get Out of Jail Free

**Effects:** After you successfully use the Dodge action, gain the benefits of the Recover action.

## Strong Arm

**Effects:** The range of your tricks is increased to 4 tiles.

## The Strong Stuff

**Effects:** The radius of your tricks is increased to 2 tiles.

## Another Trick Up My Sleeve

**Effects:** Whenever you use the Recover action while out of tricks, make a difficulty 15 Presence (Trickery) skill check. If you succeed, replenish your supply of tricks.

## Calculated

**Effects:** When used, your Just Lucky feature now increases the value of your roll by 1, rather than rerolling the result. This cannot cause it to exceed the maximum possible roll.

## Marginal

**Effects:** After you make an attack against a creature, before you choose whether or not to use your Just Lucky feature, learn the defense of the creature corresponding to the attack that you made.

## Meets It Beats It

**Effects:** Whenever your attack result is exactly equal to your target's defense, your attack becomes a critical hit.

## Bet Hedging

**Effects:** You may swap any of your placed tricks immediately before they detonate.

## Forced Card

**Prerequisites:** Magician

**Effects:** Immediately before you detonate a trick, you may pay 2 essence to swap the trick for a trick of your choice.

## Bluffer

**Effects:** Your trick cards are now played face up. You may choose whether or not to detonate them at the start of each of your turns. If you do not, the trick remains active.

## Double Tap

**Effects:** After you land a critical hit on a target, you may make an attack of opportunity against that creature.

## House Edge

**Effects:** You are immune to the effects of your own tricks.

## Hit Me

**Effects:** Gain access to the Mockery Reaction. 1 AP: whenever a basic attack made against you by a hostile creature misses, apply one stack of cursed to them.

## High Stakes

**Prerequisites:** Push Your Luck class feature

**Effects:** You may use the Push Your Luck class feature in combat to reroll skill checks.

## Reversal of Fortunes

**Effects:**  Whenever a hostile creature makes an attack roll (after you see whether or not their attack would hit), you may spend 1 AP to force them to reroll their attack roll. They must use the new result. You cannot use this ability again on that result.

## Winning Streak

**Effects:** Damage that you deal **explodes**. Whenever you roll the maximum possible value on a damage die, reroll that die and add it to the total damage dealt.

This effect can recur indefinitely. If you are rolling multiple dice, you do not need to roll maximum damage on all dice simultaneously. For example, if you hit with a pair of brass knuckles which deal 2d4 damage, and you roll a 2 and a 4, reroll the 4 and add the result to the original 6 damage that would be dealt.

## Finesse

***Effects:** Whenever one of your tricks explode, you may choose to reduce their radius to zero tiles.
