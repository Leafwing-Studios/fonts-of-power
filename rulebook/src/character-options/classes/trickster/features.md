## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Just Lucky

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** After you make an attack or damage roll (and see the immediate results), you may spend 1 essence to reroll the results. You must use the new result.

Using this feature a single time rerolls only your attack roll, or only your damage roll: the other roll remains unchanged.

### Trickery

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** 1 AP: Place a trick in a tile of your choice within a two tile range. Placed tricks explode at the start of each of your turns, affecting a 1 tile radius around them. Allies always know which trick was placed, but enemies do not.

Immediately after you use a trick, make a difficulty 10 Presence (Trickery) skill check. If you fail, your bag of tricks is empty and you cannot use this feature again for the rest of the fight.

### Flair: Payout

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Choose a subclass; which determines the flair with which you use your luck-manipulating abilities. Whenever you land a critical hit, gain a bonus effect.

### Master of Your Own Destiny

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Whenever the party would gain a Resolve, gain two Resolve instead.

### Roll the Dice

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** When you make a skill check, but before you roll, you may choose to instead attempt to change the attribute used for the skill. When you do so, you are temporarily treated as if you are proficient in the skill.

To determine which skill is used, roll a d6:

* **1:** The skill check automatically fails and you cannot use this feature again until youâ€™ve completed a rest.
* **2:** Prowess
* **3:** Agility
* **4:** Expertise
* **5:** Focus
* **6:** Presence

If you roll a 1, describe the unlikely fashion in which you attempted to perform the skill and how it failed. On any other result, describe the fashion in which you used the attribute rolled to perform the action attempted.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Dirty Tricks

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** At the start of each turn other than your own, you may spend 1 essence to immediately detonate a trick.

### Fast Talker

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** Once per rest, after you fail a Presence skill check outside of combat, you may immediately attempt the same skill check again, ignoring the first outcome.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Flair: Trump Card

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Gain access to a powerful once per combat ability.

### Push Your Luck

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** After you make a skill check outside of combat and see the results, you may choose to reroll it. If your new roll is less than your previous roll you must use the new result. Otherwise, choose whether to reroll again in this fashion or keep this as your final result.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Endless Luck

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, restore 3 + Focus / 2 essence.

## Flairs

### Favored One

#### Payout: Spontaneous Malfunction

**Effects:** When you land a critical hit, apply one stack of defenseless before calculating the damage dealt by your attack.

#### Trump Card: Plot Armor

**Effects:** The first time each combat that an attack would bring you to death's door (or hit you while you are on death's door), the attack is treated as if it missed instead.

### Magician

#### Payout: Magic Trick

**Effects:** When you land a critical hit, use a trick for free.
You must use this feature, and can do so even if your bag of tricks is empty.
Do not roll to see if your bag of tricks is empty.

#### Trump Card: Finale

**Effects:** Once per combat, when a trick that you have placed is about to detonate, you may gain the effects of any two different tricks that you know instead. You choose the order in which these resolve.

### Ruffian

#### Payout: Rough-and-Tumble

**Effects:** When you land a critical hit, you may push the creature hit into an adjacent tile of your choice.

#### Trump Card: Gumption

**Effects:** Once per combat you may set any roll to a 5 or 15, as if you had spent a Resolve.
