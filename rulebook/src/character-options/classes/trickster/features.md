## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Just Lucky

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** After you make an attack or damage roll (and see the immediate results), you may spend 1 essence to reroll the results. You must use the new result. You may use this feature on skill checks made in combat as well, at the cost of 2 essence.

Using this feature a single time rerolls only your attack roll, or only your damage roll: the other roll remains unchanged.

### Trickery

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You can use the **Trick** action:

Trick, 1 AP: Place a trick in a tile of your choice within a two tile range. Placed tricks explode at the start of you next turn, affecting a 1 tile radius around them.

Immediately after you use a trick, make a difficulty 15 Presence (Trickery) skill check. If you fail, your bag of tricks is empty and you cannot use this feature again for the rest of the fight.

### Flair: Low Blow

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Choose a subclass; which determines the flair with which you use your luck-manipulating abilities. Whenever you land a basic attack made with advantage, gain a bonus effect.

### Sleight of Hand

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** If you have at least a minute to prepare, you may choose to hide or disguise your trick, concealing its true nature (and detonation).
If you succeed on a difficulty 15 Expertise (Trickery) skill check, its nature is not obvious before it detonates and any effects which are not plainly apparent cannot be traced back to the trick.
If you succeed on a difficulty 15 Agility (Trickery) skill check, no one sees you plant the trick.
You have disadvantage on these skill checks if there is more than one observer or you are being closely watched.

### Roll the Dice

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** Test your luck, attempting to solve problems in entirely unlikely fashions.
When you make a skill check, but before you roll, you may choose to attempt to change the attribute used for the skill.
If you do so, you are temporarily treated as if you are proficient in the skill.

To determine which attribute is used, roll a d6:

* **1:** The skill check automatically fails and you cannot use this feature again until youâ€™ve completed a rest.
* **2:** Prowess
* **3:** Agility
* **4:** Expertise
* **5:** Focus
* **6:** Presence

Describe the fashion in which you used the attribute rolled to perform the action attempted.
If you rolled a 1, describe the unlikely fashion in which you attempted to perform the skill and how it failed spectacularly.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Dirty Tricks

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** At the start of each turn other than your own, you may spend 1 essence to immediately detonate a trick.

### Fast Talker

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** Once per rest, after you fail a Presence skill check outside of combat, you may immediately attempt the same skill check again, ignoring the first outcome.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Flair: Ace Up Your Sleeve

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Gain access to a powerful once per combat ability.

### Push Your Luck

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** After you make a skill check outside of combat and see the results, you may choose to reroll it. If your new roll is less than your previous roll you must use the new result. Otherwise, choose whether to reroll again in this fashion or keep it as your final result.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Flair: Top of Your Game

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Gain an incredibly powerful benefit based on your subclass.

## Flairs

### Favored One

Whether they were chosen by a god, a supernatural force, or simply due to an elaborate metanarrative joke, Favored One tricksters are inexplicably fortunate in everything they do.

#### Low Blow: Spontaneous Malfunction

**Effects:** Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, apply one stack of defenseless.

#### Ace Up Your Sleeve: Plot Armor

**Effects:** Once per combat, after you see the effects of an attack, you may cause any attack made against you to automatically miss.

#### Top of Your Game: Destiny

**Effects:** Whenever a creature in combat with you makes an attack roll (after you see whether or not their attack would hit), you may spend 1 essence to force them to reroll their attack roll. They must use the new result.

### Magician

Warping the odds through minor magic and sleight of hands, the Magician Tricksters are masters of putting on a show.

#### Low Blow: Magic Trick

**Effects:** Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, use a trick.
You must use this feature, and can do so even if your bag of tricks is empty.
After using a trick in this way, do not roll to see if your bag of tricks is empty.

#### Ace Up Your Sleeve: Card Trick

**Effects:** Once per combat, when a trick that you have placed is about to detonate, you may gain the effects of any two different tricks that you know instead. You choose the order in which these resolve.

#### Top of Your Game: Finale

**Effects:** Whenever you successfully detonate 3 or more tricks in a single turn, make a Presense attack against all enemies that can see you. If you hit, apply two stacks of any ailment of your choice.

### Ruffian

Charming rapscallions or gruff outlaws, the Ruffian Tricksters are not afraid to get down and dirty to get the job done.

#### Low Blow: Fighting Dirty

**Effects:** Whenever you hit a creature with a basic attack that you made with advantage, your critical hit threshold is reduced by 3.

#### Ace Up Your Sleeve: Kick Them While They're Down

**Effects:** Once per combat, after you successfully land a critical strike against a creature, you may immediately make an attack of opportunity against them without spending any AP.

#### Top of Your Game: Rough and Tumble

**Effects:** Whenever you spend movement in combat, you may move through enemy tiles. Attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage. At the start of each of your turns, gain the benefit of the Move action.
