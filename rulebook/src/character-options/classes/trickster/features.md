## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Just Lucky

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** After you make an attack or damage roll (and see the immediate results), you may spend 1 essence to reroll the results. You must use the new result.

Using this feature a single time rerolls only your attack roll, or only your damage roll: the other roll remains unchanged.

### Winning Streak

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** At level 1, damage that you deal **explodes**. Whenever you roll the maximum possible value on a damage die, reroll that die and add it to the total damage dealt.

This effect can recur indefinitely. If you are rolling multiple dice, you do not need to roll maximum damage on all dice simultaneously. For example, if you hit with a pair of brass knuckles which deal 2d4 damage, and you roll a 2 and a 4, reroll the 4 and add the result to the original 6 damage that would be dealt.

### Trickery

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** 0 essence 1 AP: Place a trick in a tile of your choice at range two. Placed tricks explode at the start of each of your turns, affecting a 1 tile radius around them. Allies always know which trick was placed, but enemies do not.

Immediately after you use a trick, make a difficulty 10 Presence (Trickery) skill check with advantage. If you fail, your bag of tricks is empty and you cannot use this feature again for the rest of the fight.

### Flair: Payout

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Choose a subclass; which determines the flair with which you use your luck-manipulating abilities. Whenever you land a critical hit with a basic attack, gain a bonus effect.

### Roll the Dice

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** When you make a skill check, but before you roll, you may choose to instead attempt to change the attribute used for the skill. When you do so, you are temporarily treated as if you are proficient in the skill.

To determine which skill is used, roll a d6:

* **1:** The skill check automatically fails and you cannot use this feature again until youâ€™ve completed a rest.
* **2:** Prowess
* **3:** Agility
* **4:** Expertise
* **5:** Focus
* **6:** Presence

If you roll a 1, describe the unlikely fashion in which you attempted to perform the skill and how it failed. On any other result, describe the fashion in which you used the attribute rolled to perform the action attempted.

### Push Your Luck

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** After you make a skill check outside of combat and see the results, you may choose to reroll it. If your new roll is less than your previous roll you must use the new result. Otherwise, choose whether to reroll again in this fashion or keep this as your final result.

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.
