# Notes

## Transformations

Power budget is about 3 AP per turn.
Costs 2 essence per turn, but very punishing flexibility issues.

Always have both offensive and defensive benefit.

## Fervor

Costs 2 essence to get 1 AP.
Balanced out by the fact that you're basically twice as strong as usual while transformed.
