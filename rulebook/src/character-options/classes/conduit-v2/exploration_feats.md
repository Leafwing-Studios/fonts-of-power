# Exploration Feats

## Waste Not, Want Not

**Effects:** Whenever you remove an affix using the Enchant downtime activity, you may transfer it to a different piece of gear as part of the same downtime activity, making a skill check to apply it as usual.

## MORE EXPLORATION POWERS

**Effects:** You can now use the out-of-combat effects of your body powers up to three times a day, and they can last up to eight hours each time. You can only benefit from one at once.

## EXHAUSTION POWERS

**Effects:** You may use the out-of-combat effects of your body powers any number of times per day, but gain a stack of exhaustion for each use beyond the first.
