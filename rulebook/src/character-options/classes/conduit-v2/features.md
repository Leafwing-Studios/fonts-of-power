**Source of Power:** Power flows through conduits like lifeblood,
granting them superhuman capabilities and spilling forth from their weapons in terrible bursts.
They aren't picky about where it comes from: the font itself, their allies, even the attacks of their enemies.
Unlike other adventurers, they don't *generate* power: they simply harness and shape the energy that surrounds them.

**Core Mechanic:** Conduits are a mobile, buff-heavy, bursty spellsword. Maintaining your concentration is essential to your strength, especially if you're running low on essence!

**Specialization:** Unlike most other classes, conduits have no explicit subclass. Instead, their selection of arms and powers (especially body powers) plays a major role in both the flavor and playstyle of the class. Conduits can be played as everything from a wise-cracking spellsword to an avenging angel smiting her enemies from the skies to a magical archer to a beefy grappler with magical tattoos.

**Approach to Adventure:** Conduits, more than others, tend to be focused on self-improvement and adventure as an end to itself: seeking out challenges and hardships simply to learn, grow and experience them.
They often prefer subtler approaches when solving problems, carefully manipulating people and events to line everything up, but are not above sudden shows of brute force when the situation calls for it.

**Build Fundamentals:** Conduits are solid strikers and bruisers, excelling at disruption and carefully targeted damage.

## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Conduit Casting

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As a 0 AP, 2 essence action on your turn, you may channel a **charge** into either your weapon or your body.
Each charge that you know will specify if it is a body or a weapon charge.
Each set of arms can only be charged with a  single weapon charge,
and you can only have one active body charge at once.

Weapon charges empower a set of arms that you have equipped, charging them with a burst of power.
When you make a Strike or Grapple attack with a charged set of arms,
you make a **empowered attack** against them.

If you hit your target with an empowered attack, you gain the benefit of both
your arms' basic attack and the charge that you channeled into your arms.
Then, the charge dissipates, its energy spent.
If you miss, the charge remains active, ready to be used again on your next attack.
Casting a new weapon charge replaces the already existing charge.

When making an empowered attack, your attack bonus is equal to your proficiency bonus
plus your Agility plus your Expertise, to a maximum bonus of +10.
Advantage and disadvantage on both basic and special attacks apply to this attack,
and this is treated as both a basic and a special attack for all other purposes.
If your basic attack hits more than one creature, the charge applies to all of them at half efficacy.

Body charges empower you personally, granting powerful selfish effects.
You may only be affected by a single body charge, and it persists until you lose your concentration.
Channeling a new charge into your body replaces the previous one.

When selecting powers, you may select any combination of weapon or body charges, up to the cap listed in your class table.
This cap shows the total number of powers across both categories, not the number of powers of each kind.
