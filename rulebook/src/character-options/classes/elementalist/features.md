## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Elemental Opposition

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** The elementalist is a master of magic, shaping the raw elements into tangible form to blast their foes to smithereens. Elementalist spells always cost 2 AP and 3 essence.

10 of the elements have a natural opposite, creating the following five pairings:

- Sandstorm (air and earth)
- Frostfire (fire and water)
- Darklight (radiant and umbral)
- Lifeforce (primal and decay)
- Surgebreaker (electric and corrosive)

Select a pairing and your initial spells at level 1. The number of spells you know at each level is listed in your class table.
You can only select spells from one of your pariings, and you must always know at least one spell from each of the elements in your pairings.

In addition, whenever you select a new pairing, you learn a meld spell that combines the power of both elements in your pairing. Meld spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

As you cast spells, you build up exposure to the element you are working with. You can limit this exposure by casting spells of the opposing element. As you get stronger, you learn more strategies for controlling your exposure.

Your exposure ranges from 5 in one element, to 5 in the opposed element, balancing at 0 exposure to either element in the middle. It changes in the following ways: Whenever you cast a spell, your exposure shifts towards that element by 1. If it is a critical hit, the exposure changes by 2 instead. Effects which can hit multiple creatures only change your exposure once for each time they are cast.

Whenever your exposure to an element is 3 or more, your spells of that element (other than twisting spells) are more powerful but gain a drawback. However, the critical hit threshold for spells of the opposite element is reduced by 4. Meld spells gain both of these benefits, as they count as both elements. Your stacks of exposure reset at the end of each combat.

When you reach 5 stacks, your elemental energy builds up, exploding in a powerful burst when it overwhelms you. Whenever you reach 5 stacks of exposure, you **detonate**. All creatures within a 2 tile range suffer a harmful effect based on your exposure’s type, listed in the Pairings section below. Reduce your exposure associated with that element to 0 and gain a stack of exhaustion.

## Thoughtful Orchestration

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may change your exposure by 1 in any direction.

## Element Twisting

**Level:** 1

**Effect:** You learn to manipulate the elements around you in ways that help you solve problems outside of combat. The twisting spells associated with each pairing are listed in the Pairings section below. Twisting spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

When you reach level 7 and gain access to your second pairing, you also learn the twisting spells associated with those elements. Every twisting spell increases in power at level 10 and 18.

## Elemental Intuition

**Level:** 2

**Effect:** Your familiarity with the elements allows you to innately sense them around you. You automatically detect any source or usage of your chosen elements within 4 tiles of you, and understand approximately what it is being used for. Additionally, you have advantage on any Arcana checks to understand or modify magic that uses your chosen elements.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Elemental Warding

***Level:** 4

### Elemental Crafting

***Level:** 5

**Effects:** Your knowledge of the push and pull of elemental forces allows you to balance them in the physical objects around you. You have advantage on all skill checks made to Enchant, Disenchant or Invent downtime activities as long as the affix has at least one of the elements in your pairing as a tag.

***Level:** 8

**Effects:** Your twists become more powerful or longer lasting, as described in their description.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.
