## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Elemental Opposition

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** The elementalist is a master of magic, shaping the raw elements into tangible form to blast their foes to smithereens. Elementalist spells always cost 2 AP and 1 essence.

With the exception of arcane and fate, each of the elements has a natural opposite, creating the following five pairings:

- Sandstorm (air and earth)
- Frostfire (fire and water)
- Darklight (radiant and umbral)
- Lifeforce (primal and decay)
- Surgebreaker (electric and corrosive)

Select a pairing and your initial spells at level 1. The number of spells you know at each level is listed in your class table.
You can only select spells from one of your pariings, and you must always know at least one spell from each element in your pairing.

In addition, you learn a meld spell that combines the power of both elements in your pairing. Meld spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

As you cast spells, you build up exposure to the element you are working with. You can limit this exposure by casting spells of the opposing element.

Your exposure ranges from 5 in one element, to 5 in the opposed element, balancing at 0 exposure to either element in the middle. It changes in the following ways:

- Whenever you cast a spell, your exposure shifts towards that element by 1.
- If it is a critical hit, the exposure changes by 2 instead.
- When you use a meld spell, your exposure in your current element increases by one. If your exposure is zero, gain one exposure in an associated element of your choice.
- Effects which can hit multiple creatures only change your exposure once for each time they are cast.

Whenever your exposure to an element is 3 or more, your spells of that element (other than twisting spells) are more powerful but gain a drawback. However, the critical hit threshold for spells of the opposite element is reduced by 4. Meld spells gain both of these benefits, as they count as both elements. Your stacks of exposure reset at the end of each combat.

When you reach 5 stacks, your elemental energy builds up, exploding in a powerful burst when it overwhelms you. Whenever you reach 5 stacks of exposure, you **detonate**. All creatures within a 2 tile range suffer a harmful effect based on your exposure’s type, listed in the Pairings section below. Reduce your exposure associated with that element to 0 and gain a stack of exhaustion.

### Pure Power

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Once during each of your turns, you may spend essence in the place of AP when using an action. For example, if you wanted to take the Strike action, you would spend 2 essence and 0 AP.

### Element Twisting

**Level:** 1

**Effect:** You learn to manipulate the elements around you in ways that help you solve problems outside of combat. Gain access to the twisting spells for your associated elements, which are listed in the Pairings section below. Twisting spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

Twisting spells cannot be used in combat, as they are either too intricate or time consuming to cast in the heat of battle.

### Elemental Intuition

**Level:** 2

**Effect:** Your familiarity with the elements allows you to innately sense them around you. You automatically detect any source or usage of your chosen elements within 50 feet of you, and understand approximately what it is being used for. Additionally, you have advantage on any Arcana checks to understand or modify magic that uses your chosen elements.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Elemental Warding

***Level:** 4

When you use the Ward action, until the start of your next turn, gain immunity to the damage types in your elemental pairing and ignore any ailments or afflictions applied to yourself.

### Font Communion

***Level:** 5

**Effects:** Gain access to the Commune downtime activity. When you use this downtime activity, make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check. For every 5 points of the skill check result, ask one question of the worldspeaker, who must do their best to answer truthfully:

- What elements is this font associated with?
- What are the font-level vantages, if any?
- What danger levels are present in this font, and where are they located?
- What does this font currently want, if anything?
- Are there any important monsters or creatures in this font's area of influence?

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Gentle Touch

***Level:** 7

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may change your exposure by 1 in any direction.

### Major Twist

***Level:** 8

**Effects:** Your twists become more powerful or longer lasting, as described in their description.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Currents of Power

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, gain an effect based on your current exposure:

- 0: Gain the benefits of the Defend and Ward actions.
- 1-2: Set your exposure to any value of your choice.
- 3-4: Until the end of your next turn, whenever you cast a spell, you may choose whether or not it is a critical hit.
