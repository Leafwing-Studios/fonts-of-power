# Exploration Feats

## Twisted Hose

**Prerequisites:** Frostfire elemental pairing

**Effects:** As part of your frost twisting spell, you may instead create water out of nothing. You can create water at a rate of roughly 1 gallon every 30 seconds (roughly the rate of a kitchen tap).

At level 8, this increases to a rate of 1 gallon per second (roughly the rate of a fire hose). Additionally, you may focus this blast of water into a small stream, which pushes creatures and objects back with considerable (but non-damaging) force.

## Twisted Beacon

**Prerequisites:** Darklight elemental pairing

**Effects:** Twisting and shaping a source of light, you cause it to glow brilliantly. Select a light source of your choice within range. Until you complete a rest, you can control the intensity and shape of its illumination. At most, you can double the overall intensity and/or radius, and focus the direction of the light as if it were a partially shielded lantern.

At level 8, you can increase the intensity and/or radius by a factor of eight instead of two, allowing it to be seen for miles around.

## Twisted Stifling

**Prerequisites:** Darklight elemental pairing

**Effects:** With a flick of the wrist, you cause shadows to grow and extinguish light sources. When you cast this spell, extinguish a light source of your choice within range.

If you are level 8 or higher, the light source you extinguish cannot be relit until you complete a rest unless the creature attempting to relight the light source succeeds on a contested Presence (Arcana) skill check against you. You may choose to fail this skill check.
