# Exploration Feats

## Twisted Breeze

**Prerequisites:** Sandstorm elemental pairing

**Effects:** The wind obeys your oommand, gently blowing and gusting as part of your Wind Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell, you can control the wind: anywhere from dead still air to a gentle breeze to a stiff but harmless gust in the direction of your choice.

You may use a downtime activity to change the weather for the next day to any natural form of weather for the region (however rare)

If you are level 8 or higher, you may immediately change the weather for the area around you.

## Twisted Tunnelling

**Prerequisites:** Sandstorm elemental pairing

**Effects:** The earth parts and reforms around you, offering you passage as part of your Stone Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell, you may burrow through earth and stone as if swimming.
You do not need to breathe, and can see outside of the earth as if it were clouded glass.

If you are level 8 or higher, grant this effect to up to 6 additional allies.

## Twisted Cleansing

**Prerequisites:** ?? elemental pairing

**Effects:** Your fire cleanses as it burns away impurities. Fire modified as part of your Flame Twisting spell burns selectively, ignoring any substance or creature(s) of your choice.

If you are level 8 or higher, fires created by you are hot enough to slowly burn or melt through most materials: limestone (but not granite), iron, glass and copper (but not tungsten) and so on.

## Twisted Hose

**Prerequisites:** Frostfire elemental pairing

**Effects:** As part of your Frost Twisting spell, you may instead create water out of nothing.
You can create water at a rate of roughly 1 gallon every 30 seconds (roughly the rate of a kitchen tap).

At level 8, this increases to a rate of 1 gallon per second (roughly the rate of a fire hose). Additionally, you may focus this blast of water into a small stream, which pushes creatures and objects back with considerable (but non-damaging) force.

## Twisted Beacon

**Prerequisites:** Darklight elemental pairing

**Effects:** Twisting and shaping a source of light, you may cause it to glow brilliantly as part of your Brilliant Twisting spell.
Select a light source of your choice within range. Until you complete a rest, you can control the intensity and shape of its illumination.
At most, you can double the overall intensity and/or radius, and focus the direction of the light as if it were a partially shielded lantern.

At level 8, you can increase the intensity and/or radius by a factor of eight instead of two, allowing it to be seen for miles around.

## Twisted Stifling

**Prerequisites:** Darklight elemental pairing

**Effects:** With a flick of the wrist, you cause shadows to grow and extinguish light sources as part of your Shadow Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell you may instead extinguish a light source of your choice within range.

If you are level 8 or higher, the light source you extinguish cannot be relit until you complete a rest unless the creature attempting to relight the light source succeeds on a contested Presence (Arcana) skill check against you. You may choose to fail this skill check.

## Twisted Growth

**Prerequisites:** Lifeforce elemental pairing

**Effects:** Planting a seed of life, you encourage healthy growth as part of your Life Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell, you may imbue a single living creature, plant or fungi with life, causing it to grow vigorously for the next year.
As a downtime activity, you may apply this to an entire farm.

If you are level 8 or higher, you may rapidly accelerate growth: causing an entire year of growth to occur in a single minute. If you use this ability more than once each rest, gain a stack of exhaustion.

## Twisted Afterlife

**Prerequisites:** Lifeforce elemental pairing

**Effects:** Reaching out into the beyond, you  as part of your Death Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell, you have advantage on any skill checks made to use the Resurrect downtime activity.

If you are level 8 or higher, you may resurrect creatures that would otherwise be unresurrectable.

## Twisted Electrokinesis

**Prerequisites:** Surgebreaker elemental pairing

**Effects:** As part of your Lightning Twisting spell, lightning flows gently into an object of your choice within range, allowing you to move it as it takes on a modicum of life for a moment.
You may move the object and perform any straightforward feat of dexterity such as opening doors, setting a table or approximately tossing an object.
You may not activate magical items in this fashion and the force exerted by this effect is limited by your own strength.
You may not perform any particularly challenging tasks in this fashion: anything which would require a skill check, such as picking a lock, carefully stealing an item or breaking open a door is beyond its capacity. When you cast this spell, you may move the object up to 30 feet, although it falls harmlessly to the ground shortly afterwards.

Like always, this twisting has no effect in combat: you may not make attacks or wield weapons in this way.

If you are level 8 or higher, you may perform acts that require dexterity while using this spell.

## Twisted Chemistry

**Prerequisites:** Surgebreaker elemental pairing

**Effects:** You may create useful alchemical reagents as part of your Acid Twisting spell.
When you cast this spell, gain advantage on any Tinkering skill check made to create chemicals using the Tinkering skill.
This applies to the Devise downtime activity (but no other downtime activities).

If you are level 8 or higher, gain advantage on any attempt to use chemicals as well.
