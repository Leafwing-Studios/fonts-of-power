# Combat Feats

## Fast Burning

**Effects:** You can use your Pure Power class feature twice during each of your turns, rather than once.

## Master of the Elements

**Effects:** Gain access to a second elemental pairing. You gain access to the twists and hybrid Meld spell associated with that pairing, and any features that depend on this. Learn two additional powers.
Detonating only resets the elemental exposure for the pair of elements that was detonated.

When you gain this combat feat, sacrifice an exploration feat.

## Shaped Charge

**Effects:** Each time you use your Detonation feature, select one of the following shapes for the effect:

- a 2 tile radius centered on yourself
- a 3 tile radius cone centered on yourself, in a direction of your choosing, including yourself
- a 1 tile by 12 tile line, starting at yourself, in a direction of your choosing, including yourself

### Power Siphon

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you hit a creature with a Shove, Strike or Grapple attack, gain the benefits of the Recover action.

### Extremism

**Effects:** Whenever you cast a spell, change your exposure by 2 rather than 1. Whenever you land a critical hit, change it by 3 rather than 2.

### Perfect Balance

**Effects:** While you are at 0 stacks of exposure, gain the enhanced version of all spells. Their critical hit threshold is reduced by 4.

### Knife's Edge

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, if you are at 3 or more stacks of exposure, gain an additional AP.

### Alternating Detonation

**Effects:** You no longer gain exhaustion when detontating unless it was the same detonation that you last triggered this combat.

### Spellblade

**Effects:** After you hit a creature with a basic attack, reduce the AP cost of your next spell by 1. This effect can stack, but may only trigger once per action.

### Explosive Propulsion

**Effects:** After you cast a spell, if you have three or more stacks of the element that corresponds to that spell, push yourself one tile away from your target.
After you detonate, push yourself 4 tiles in a direction of your choice.
