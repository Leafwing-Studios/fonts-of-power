# Combat Feats

## Master of the Elements

**Effects:** Gain access to a second elemental pairing. You gain access to the twists and hybrid Meld spell associated with that pairing, and any features that depend on this . Learn two additional powers.
Detonating only resets the elemental exposure for the pair of elements that was detonated.

When you gain this combat feat, sacrifice an exploration feat.

## Shaped Charge

**Effects:** When you use your Detonation feature, select one of the following shapes for the effect:

- a 10-foot radius sphere centered on yourself
- a 20-foot cone centered on yourself, in a direction of your choosing
- a 40-foot x 5 foot line, starting at yourself, in a direction of your choosing

## Power Cycle

**Effects:** Whenever you would detonate, you may choose to gain 3 essence rather than the effect listed in your elemental pairing.

## Gentle Touch

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may change your exposure by 1 in any direction.

### Power Siphon

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you hit a creature with a Shove, Strike or Grapple attack, gain the benefits of the Recover action.

### Extremism

**Effects:** Whenever you cast a spell, change your exposure by 2 rather than 1. Whenever you land a critical hit, change it by 3 rather than 2.

### Hair-Trigger Detonation

**Effects:** The maximum number of stacks of exposure that you can have is reduced to 5. Any effects (such as your Detonation class feature) that trigger at 7 stacks of exposure now trigger at 5 instead.

### Perfect Balance

**Effects:** While you are at 0 stacks of exposure, gain the enhanced version of all spells. Their critical hit threshold is reduced by 4.

### Paradoxical Effect

**Effects:** Whenever you gain exposure, you may choose the direction (but not amount) of the exposure gained.

### Knife's Edge

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, if you are at 4 or more stacks of exposure, gain an additional AP.

### Alternating Detonation

**Effects:** Whenever you detonate, if it is not the same element as your last detonation, any attack made is automatically a critical if it hits.

### Spellblade

**Effects:** After you hit a creature with a basic attack, reduce the AP cost of your next spell by 1. This effect can stack.
