# Exploration Feats

## Natural Spies

**Effects:** Your elementals have advantage on all Stealth skill checks made while out of combat.

## Delegation

**Effects:** When using your Many Hands Make Light Work class feature, rather than choosing to gain advantage on the skill check, you may instead choose to gain the benefits of an additional downtime activity. If you fail the skill check, you do not gain the benefit of your original downtime activity as your elementals failed to complete the task unsupervised.

## Effortless Coordination

**Effects:** You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Many Hands Make Light Work class feature. If you succeed, an ally of your choice gains advantage on all downtime activity skill checks made this rest.

## Power of Speech

**Effects:** Your elementals can speak any languages that you speak.
