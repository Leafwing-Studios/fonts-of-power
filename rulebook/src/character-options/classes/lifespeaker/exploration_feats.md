# Exploration Feats

## Natural Spies

**Effects:** Your creatures have advantage on all Stealth skill checks made while out of combat.

## Delegation

**Effects:** When using your Many Hands Make Light Work class feature, rather than choosing to gain advantage on the skill check, you may instead choose to gain the benefits of an additional downtime activity. If you fail the skill check, you do not gain the benefit of your original downtime activity as your creatures failed to complete the task unsupervised.

## Effortless Coordination

**Effects:** You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Many Hands Make Light Work class feature. If you succeed, an ally of your choice gains advantage on all downtime activity skill checks made this rest.

## Power of Speech

**Effects:** Your creatures can speak any languages that you speak.

## Telepathic Bond

**Effects:** You may communicate telepathically at any distance with your creatures.

## Breath of Life

**Effects:** Treat any skill checks made as part of the Resurrect downtime activity as if the results were 5 higher.

## Intelligent Design

**Effects:** You gain access to the Intelligent Design downtime activity. When you use this activity, make an Expertise skill check with your choice of the Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering skills. For every 5 points of your skill check result, you may replace one form that you know with a new one.
