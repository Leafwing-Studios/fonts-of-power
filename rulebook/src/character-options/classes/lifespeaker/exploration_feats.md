# Exploration Feats

## Natural Spies

**Effects:** Your creatures have advantage on all Stealth skill checks made while out of combat.

## Delegation

**Effects:** When using your Many Hands Make Light Work class feature, rather than choosing to gain advantage on the skill check, you may instead choose to gain the benefits of an additional downtime activity. If you fail the skill check, you do not gain the benefit of the chosen downtime activity, as your creatures failed to complete the task unsupervised. (You still gain the benefits of the downtime activity that you chose to perform yourself.)

## Effortless Coordination

**Effects:** You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Many Hands Make Light Work class feature. If you succeed, an ally of your choice gains advantage on all downtime activity skill checks made this rest.

## Telepathic Bond

**Effects:** You may communicate telepathically at any distance with your creatures. You do not gain access to their senses, and they do not become any more intelligent, but they can still communicate general feelings/perceptions and yes/no answers to you.

## Breath of Life

**Effects:** When you use the Resurrect downtime activity, you may choose to reroll any skill checks made. You must use the new result.

## Intelligent Design

**Effects:** You gain access to the Intelligent Design downtime activity. When you use this activity, make an Expertise skill check with your choice of the Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering skills. For every 5 points of your skill check result, you may replace one form that you know with a new one.

## Loyal Companions

**Effects:** Your creatures can speak any language that you speak, are more intelligent and, are able to act with autonomy. Each creature has a personality and memory of its own.

## Relentless Rats

**Prerequisites:** Horde summoning strategy

**Effects:** Outside of combat, your creature cap is increased to a finite but arbitrarily large number, although it still takes a few seconds to summon each one. They only persist until the end of your next rest, and you can still only begin combat with 9 of them.

## Caloric

**Effects:** Your summoned creatures can be consumed, providing healthy food and water to anyone who eats them.
