## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Lifespeaking

**Level:** 1

With a word, you breathe life into the raw materials of the world around you: conjuring strange creatures, bringing water to life, and shaping mud into slow-witted assistants.

In combat, you control up to three creatures in addition to your character.
Your creatures may spend your AP as if they were their own.
They do not gain AP normally, but during your turn you may spend up to 4 essence per turn to grant any creature one AP per essence spent.

Creatures can take any core action.
When they use the Essence Tap, Recover or Activate actions, you gain the benefits and pay the costs in their place.
When they use the Defend or Ward actions, grant the benefits of that action to all of your creatures.

Each creature that you summon has a specific form. Each form has a set of statistics:

- Life total
- Attributes
- Basic attack bonus, special attack bonus, basic defense and special defenses
- A unique passive
- A basic attack
- A special attack

Creatures share your skill proficiencies, and gain the benefit of any feats, species or class features, item enchantments or temporary buffs that affect you.
The number of forms that you have access to increases as you level up, as shown in your class table.
To ease your playing experience, we strongly recommend that you create stat cards for each form of creature you can summon,
and then reference those as you play.

The flavor of this class is deliberately flexible: your character may be a master of the elements commanding spirits of water, a necromancer bringing back spirits and skeletons, a mad biologist with chimeric creations, or a technomancer who builds strange turrets and clockwork machines on the fly.
While the forms listed here are all elementals, when you select forms, feel free to reflavor them completely to match your desired aesthetics.
When you do so, you may freely swap any damage type for any other, any affliction for any other, and any ailment for any other.
Note that these are durable choices that should be recorded on the stat card of your creature: it cannot be changed once selected except by the ordinary mechanisms of altering character choices.

At the start of combat, place your active creatures in a position of your choice within a 2 tile range of your character.

You gain access to the Summon Creature action. At the cost of 2 AP, summon a new creature with a form of your choice within a 2 tile range. You may summon any number of additional creatures, at the cost of 1 essence each.
You cannot control more than creatures than your creature cap (default 3) at once: if you are already at your cap, destroy an creature of your choice before summoning a new one.

## Summoning Strategy

**Level:** 1

Choose one of the summoning strategies, listed below:

### Monster Master

You may only have one creature of each kind summoned at once. During combat, their life total persists, even when not summoned.
When you use the Summon Creature action, you may replace a creature with another creature, ignoring range.

When you regain life, heal all of your summons by that amount as well.
At the end of each combat, your creatures are all healed to full.
You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Essence Tap action.

### Horde

Your creature cap is increased to 5. At the start of each of your turns, each of your creatures may take the Move action for free.

### Absolute Unit

Your creature cap is reduced to 1, and your creature is now 1 tile radius in size.
When you gain this feature, choose three forms: you do not know any other forms, but may change this selection whenever you would gain a new form. Your creature's life total is the sum of those three forms, and its attributes are the average of the values of those forms, rounded up.
Your creature gains all of the special actions and passive features of all three forms.

## Manifestations of Power

Your creatures cannot be affected by other creatures. They still interact with the environment normally, but cannot take damage, gain ailments or afflictions or be involuntarily destroyed. They must stay within a 3 tile range of you at all times or they vanish. They cannot grapple or be grappled, and do not prevent movement of creatures through their space.

### Turrets

Your creatures cannot take movement actions and cannot be knocked prone.
At the start of each of your turns, you may take the Strike or Grapple action with any one of your creatures.
Reduce the cost of your Summon Creature action by one AP.

## Helpful Creations

**Level:** 1

Your creatures persist outside of combat. At the start of each rest, select a number of active creatures equal to your creature cap.
These creatures can be freely summoned and dismissed, but cannot be swapped for alternative creatures unless you are in combat or resting.

creatures can be very helpful in small ways while exploring the world: they are reasonably strong, autonomous, with basic senses and manipulation abilities, but are about as intelligent as a well-trained dog.
creatures are capable of understanding languages that you know, but cannot speak or otherwise communicate beyond vague gestures, even to you.

## Many Hands Make Light Work

**Level:** 2

Whenever you use a downtime activity, you may make a difficulty 15 Focus (Fontcraft) skill check.
If you succeed, gain advantage on all skill checks made as part of that downtime activity.
If you fail by 5 or more, gain a stack of exhaustion.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Laughing Spirits

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** After you or an creature succesfully dodge an attack, you may swap that character's position with your character or an creature of your choice via teleportation.

## Possession

**Level:** 5

You learn to take over the body of an creature complete, entering into a deep trance. After a brief time in a calm environment, you enter into a trance, becoming unable to move or take any actions but retaining a vague sense of the state of your own surroundings.
Instead, you control your entity directly, gaining access to any senses and abilities it may have as you are connected by a telepathic link.

You may choose to end this effect at any time.
Ending this effect is immediate, and you may choose to instead swap to possess a different creature rather than returning to your own body.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### creature Mastery

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** The cost of your Summon Creature action is reduced to 1 AP, and its range is increased to 3 tiles.

### Life Everywhere

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You learn to breathe life into ordinary objects, giving them crude powers of thought, observation and motion.

By spending a moment directly beside an object, you may **animate** it.
You may only animate one object at once in this way, and the effect fades at the end of your next rest.

While they are useless in combat, animated objects behave as if they were one of your summoned creatures outside of combat, and benefit from any exploration feature that improves your creatures.
When animated, their appearance does not change, and while they are capable of basic tasks, they are not strong enough to break themselves apart.
For example, an animated chest would be able to slowly hop around and throw itself off a cliff, but it could not bypass a magical seal, or fall apart on command.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Life of its Own

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, grant 2 AP to your creatures, divided as you choose.
