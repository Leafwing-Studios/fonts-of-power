## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Lifespeaking

**Level:** 1

With a word, you breathe life into the raw materials of the world around you: conjuring strange creatures, bringing water to life, and shaping mud into slow-witted assistants.

In combat, you control up to three creatures in addition to your character.
Your creatures may spend your AP as if it were their own.
They do not gain AP normally, but during your turn you may spend up to 4 essence per turn to grant any creature one AP per essence spent.

Creatures can take any core action.
When they use the Essence Tap, Recover or Activate actions, you gain the benefits and pay the costs in their place.

Each creature that you summon has a specific form, with it's own statistics and attributes.
Creatures share your skill proficiencies, but do not share feats, class features, species features, etc.
The number of creatureforms that you have access to increases as you level up, as shown in your class table.

The flavor of this class is deliberately flexible: your character may be a master of the elements commanding elementals of water, a necromancer bringing back spirits and skeletons, a mad biologist with chimeric creations, or a technomancer who builds strange turrets and clockwork machines on the fly.
While the forms listed here are all elementals, when you select forms, feel free to reflavor them completely to match your desired aesthetics.
When you do so, you may freely swap any damage type for any other, any affliction for any other, and any ailment for any other.
Note that these are durable choices that should be recorded on the stat card of your creature: it cannot be changed once selected except by the ordinary mechanisms of altering character choices.

At the start of combat, place your active creatures in a position of your choice within a 2 tile range of your character.

You gain access to the Summon Creature action. At the cost of 2 AP, summon a new creature into an empty tile(s), with a form of your choice, within a 2 tile range.
You may summon any number of additional creatures, at the cost of 1 essence each.
You cannot control more than creatures than your creature cap (default 3) at once: if you are already at your cap, destroy a creature of your choice before summoning a new one.

### Summoning Strategy

**Level:** 1

Choose one of the summoning strategies, listed below:

#### Semi-Autonomous

At the start of each of your turns, each of your creatures may take the Move action for free.

#### Monster Master

You may only have one creature of each kind summoned at once. During combat, their life total persists, even when not summoned.
When you use the Summon Creature action, you may replace a creature with another creature, ignoring range.

When you regain life, heal all of your summons by that amount as well.
At the end of each combat, your creatures are all healed to full.
You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Essence Tap action.

#### Horde

You do not have a creature cap, and begin combat with 9 creatures.
Your creatures are all size 0.
Whenever you would summon a creature, summon 1 creature (rounded down) of the same kind for every 3 life of that creature form instead.
You may choose how to position these (within range).

Whenever a creature uses a movement action, all your other creatures may gain the benefit of that movement action.

Your creatures do not have a life pool.
Instead, whenever they would take damage, destroy it.

Outside of combat, you may only have 20 of creatures active at once.

#### Absolute Unit

Your creature cap is reduced to 1.
When you gain this feature, choose the size of your creature: between 1 and 9 tiles.
Then, choose three forms.
Your creature's life total is the sum of those three forms, and its attributes are the average of the values of those forms, rounded up.
Your creature gains all of the special actions and passive features of all three forms.
Whenever it strikes, you may choose which of the three base strike options you want to use.

Whenever you gain new forms, add those to your pool.
Gain access to the Splice downtime activity, which lets you swap a form you know for one of the three active ones on your unit.

### Helpful Creations

**Level:** 1

Your creatures persist outside of combat. At the start of each rest, select a number of active creatures equal to your creature cap.
These creatures can be freely summoned and dismissed, but cannot be swapped for alternative creatures unless you are in combat or resting.

Creatures can be very helpful in small ways while exploring the world: they are reasonably strong, autonomous, with basic senses and manipulation abilities, but are about as intelligent as a well-trained dog.
Creatures are capable of understanding languages that you know, but cannot speak or otherwise communicate beyond vague gestures, even to you.

### Many Hands Make Light Work

**Level:** 2

Whenever you use a downtime activity, you may make a difficulty 15 Focus (Fontcraft) skill check.
If you succeed, gain advantage on all skill checks made as part of that downtime activity.
If you fail by 5 or more, gain a stack of exhaustion.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Laughing Spirits

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** After you or an creature succesfully dodge an attack, you may swap that character's position with your character or an creature of your choice via teleportation.

### Possession

**Level:** 5

You learn to take over the body of one of your creatures. 
After a brief time in a calm environment (not in combat), you enter into a trance, becoming unable to move or take any actions but retaining a vague sense of the state of your own surroundings.
Instead, you control that creature directly, gaining access to any senses and abilities it may have as you are connected by a telepathic link.
Remember, although it gains your decision making ability and intelligence, it can't do anything that it couldn't physically do before (like speaking).

You may choose to end this effect at any time.
Ending this effect is immediate, and you may choose to instead possess a different creature rather than returning to your own body.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Creature Mastery

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** The cost of your Summon Creature action is reduced to 1 AP, and its range is increased to 3 tiles.

### Life Everywhere

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You learn to breathe life into ordinary objects, giving them crude powers of thought, observation and motion.

By spending a moment directly beside an object, you may **animate** it.
You may only animate one object at once in this way, and the effect fades at the end of your next rest.

While they are useless in combat, animated objects behave as if they were one of your summoned creatures outside of combat, and benefit from any exploration feature that improves your creatures.
When animated, their appearance does not change, and while they are capable of basic tasks, they are not strong enough to break themselves apart.
For example, an animated chest would be able to slowly hop around and throw itself off a cliff, but it could not bypass a magical seal, or fall apart on command.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Masterpiece

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Gain a powerful bonus to your summoned creatures, based on the summoning strategy you selected.

#### Semi-Autonomous: Life of their Own

At the start of each of your turns, each of your creatures may take an additional 1 AP action of their choice.

#### Monster Master: Heartfelt Bond

Whenever one of your creatures is defeated or lands a critical hit, the party gains a resolve.

At the end of combat, the party loses one resolve for each resolve gained this way.

#### Horde: Overwhelming Numbers

Once during your turn, you or one of your creatures may ignore the AP cost of an action while making an attack of opportunity.

#### Absolute Unit: Raw Power

After your creature hits with an attack, you may spend 1 essence to make it a critical hit.
