## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Prayer

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As a Devout, your powers are known as **prayers**. Casting a prayer costs 2 AP and increases your favor by 1.

**Favor** is used to improve the odds of succesfully calling upon miracles.
It resets to zero at the start of every fight, and miracles cannot be sustained between fights.

### Miracle

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You gain access to the **miracle** action, which costs 3 AP.

Choose a prayer that you know, and attempt to cast a sustained miracle version of it. To see if this succeeds, you must make a **favor check**:

1. Choose how much essence to spend, increasing the final result by the essence spent.
2. Determine the base result by rolling a number of d20s based on your current favor:
   - Favor < 0: roll |Favor| + 1 d20s and use the lowest result.
   - Favor = 0: roll 1 d20 and use that result.
   - Favor > 0: roll Favor + 1 d20s and use the highest result.
3. Add the amount of essence you spent in step 1 to your base result.
4. You succeed if and only if the final result is 20 or higher.

As a party, you may choose to spend Resolve to modify the result of this roll.
Typically, this will set the result to a 15.

If the favor check is successful, gain the benefit of an incredibly powerful miracle that lasts until your concentration is broken or the end of combat.

If it fails, your favor decreases by 1 and you suffer the Consequences laid out by your Devotion subclass.

### Devotion

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Determine the nature of the supreme power that you worship. Choose 3 elemental domains, which determine the prayers that you can learn.

Additionally, select the nature of the power. At level 1, this determines the consequences of failing to cast a miracle.

### Deliberation

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You have advantage on skill checks made to maintain your concentration.

### Augury

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain access to the Augury downtime activity.

During this downtime activity, you may ask the worldspeaker one yes or no question.
Whether or not they answer truthfully depends on both random chance and the nature of your devotion.
Check your subclass for the exact mechanics.

### Ritual

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** You learn to perform intricate rituals to win your deityâ€™s blessing. You gain access to the Ritual downtime activity. When you complete this downtime activity, gain the benefit of the Miracle version of a prayer that you know as if you'd used the Invoke major action and passed your Favor check.

This effect does not persist into combat.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Reprieve

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** After you successfully cast a miracle, gain the benefits of the Defend and Ward actions.

### Sage Reputation

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** You have advantage on all Guidance skill checks made outside of downtime and combat.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Desperate Plea

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Once per rest, you may treat a failure on a Favor or concentration skill check as if it were a success.

### Privileged Information

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** Once per rest, you may immediately gain the benefit of the Augury downtime activity specific to your subclass.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Miracle Worker

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** You can sustain two miracles at once. If your concentration is lost, both miracles end.

## Devotions

## Benevolent

### Consequence: Disappointment

**Effects:** You instead immediately cast the standard version of the prayer you selected. Like usual, your favor is increased by 1 after casting a prayer.

### Augury: Vague Portents

When you use your Augury downtime activity, roll a d20. If the result is 10 or less, you cannot discern any useful information. If the result is 11 or higher, you learn the true answer.

## Malevolent

### Consequence: Power at Any Price

**Effects:** You cast the Miracle version of the prayer you selected, but the hostile or adversarial creature with the highest current life gains the benefit of an identical miracle as well.

### Augury: Malicious Advice

When you use your Augury downtime activity, roll a d20. If the result is 5 or less, you are told the wrong answer. If the result is 6 or higher, you learn the true answer.

## Primordial

### Consequence: Direct Line

**Effects:** You cast the miracle version of the prayer you selected, but must make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check to mitigate the damage done by the uncontrolled energy flowing through your body. Gain 5 stacks of exhaustion, reduced by 1 stack for each 5 points of your skill check result.

### Augury: Places of Power

When you use your Augury downtime activity, roll a d20, then add 5 times the current danger level to the result. If the final result is 20 or higher, you learn the true answer. Otherwise, learn nothing.
