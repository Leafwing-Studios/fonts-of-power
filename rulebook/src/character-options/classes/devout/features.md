## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Prayer

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** 2 AP: cast a simple **prayer** and increase your favor by 1.

Favor is used to improve the odds of succesfully calling upon miracles.

### Miracle

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** 3 AP: Choose a prayer, and attempt to cast a sustained **miracle**. To see if this succeeds, you must make a **favor check**:

1. Choose how much essence to spend, increasing the final result by the essence spent.
2. Roll a number of d20s based on your current favor.
3. If your result was 20 or higher, you succeeded. Otherwise, you failed.

The number of d20s rolled based on your current favor, in a fashion similar to advantage and disadvantage:

- Favor < 0: roll X + 1 d20s, where X is the absolute value of your Favor, and use the lowest result
- Favor = 0: roll 1 d20 and use that result
- Favor > 0: roll Y + 1 d20s, where Y your Favor, and use the highest result.

As a party, you may choose to spend Resolve to modify the result of this rol.

If the favor check is successful, gain the benefit of an incredibly powerful miracle that lasts until your concentration is broken or the end of combat.

If it fails, your favor decreases by 1 and you suffer the Consequences laid out by your Devotion subclass.
