**Effects:** In addition to your character, you also control a **companion** that shares your body. They share your skill proficiencies and attribute bonuses. In combat, the companion can only use the Strike, Spot, Scan, Swap and Block actions.

You and your companion are treated as the same character: you cannot make attacks of opportunity after the other causes enemies within your zone of control to lose life.

When your companion makes a basic attack, it uses your special attack bonus instead of your basic attack bonus.
Add your Presence rather than your Prowess to its basic attacks.

Your companion does not regain AP as usual. At the start of your turn, you may spend up to 3 essence. Your companion gains one AP for each essence spent. These AP are lost at the start of your next turn as usual.

- Is my current course of action likely to succeed?
- Is there another way to accomplish my goals?
- Are there any dangers I haven't noticed?

## Coexistence Strategies

### Camraderie

#### Dynamic: Counterpoint

If you and your companion attack the same target in a turn, the second attack has advantage if it is from opposite range category (melee vs ranged).

Once during your turn, your companion may spend 1 AP to cause you to shift once.

#### Synergy: Spirited

The first time during your turn that you or your companion hits with an attack, the other gains 1 AP.

#### Unity: Interplay

When you gain this feature, choose a damage type.

Whenever the host hits with an attack, regain 1 essence.

Whenever the companion hits with an attack, you may spend 1 essence to deal 1d12 + Presence damage of the chosen damage type.
This bonus damage is halved for multi-target attacks.

These effects can only trigger once per action taken: they cannot be triggered multiple times due to a single area of effect attack, and cannot be triggered multiple times due to tile effects that you create.
However, both of these effects can be triggered due to a single joint action, such as your Unleash class feature.

### Symbiosis

#### Dynamic: Stronger Together

Whenever you or your companion spend AP to use an offensive action, the other may spend the same amount of AP. If you do, double the efficacy of that action.

Your companion gains access to the Dodge action.
Your companion has advantage on all Block and Dodge skill checks.

#### Synergy: Second Skin

Whenever you lose absorption due to an attack, you may make an attack of opportunity against your attacker.

#### Unity: Backstop

During combat, after you see the immediate results of an attack roll or skill check, you may treat that roll as if you had rolled a 10.
You may only do this once each turn for a roll made by your companion, and once each turn for a roll made by the host.

You choose whether or not to change the effective roll after you have rolled the dice, see if the skill check succeeded or attack hit, but before other characters choose whether to react.

### Tension

#### Dynamic: Balance of Power

At the start of each of your turns, choose companion or host. Until the start of your next turn, the chosen half has advantage on all attack rolls, the other has disadvantage on all attack rolls.

Whenever you or your companion fails a skill check in combat, the other gains advantage on the next skill check they make this combat.

#### Synergy: Vital Struggle

You and your companion are learning to bolster each other as you fight.

Whenever you would lose life, you may choose to lose half that much essence instead. When you would spend essence, you may choose to lose twice that much life instead.

This feature can not be used if you do not have enough life or essence to pay the cost.

#### Unity: Perfect Imbalance

You have mastered the interplay yourself and your companion, allowing you to change mental and physical state at will.

At the start of each of your turns, you may switch which of you is in complete control (host or companion), or enter a blended state.

While in your host form, you and your companion have advantage on all skill checks made in combat.

While in your companion form, damage dealt by you or your companion cannot be prevented.

While in a blended form, you may spend 1 essence (or equivalently, 2 life) to reroll any attack roll that you make. You must use this new result unless you repeat this effect, doubling its cost each time it's used on the same attack.
