## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Homeland

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Choose a terrain, elemental damage type, ailment and affliction. Wildshaping powers take on those effects.

### Wildshaping

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** 0 AP, 1 essence: Pick a tile within a 6 tile range and choose one:

- Shape it, causing it to gain the tile effect specified by your choice of terrain.
- Unshape it, removing this tile effect.

If the tile is shaped and within a 3 tile range, you may instead use a **wildshaping** that you know. Wildshapings apply an effect in the selected tile and all connected shaped tiles of the same type.

Tiles stay shaped until the end of combat. Other creatures may clear a single adjacent tile via the Interact action.

### Overgrowth

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** After you spend essence other than to unshape a tile, if you are able to, you must shape 1 unshaped tile within a 3 tile range per point of essence spent.

### Land's Connection

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** While you are on your own shaped terrain, you may treat any connected tiles as if they were adjacent for the purpose of the Strike, Treat and Shove actions. This does not increase your zone of control.

### Wilderness Lore

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** Downtime activity. Make a Focus (Anima) skill check. Learn 1 fact about the area you are currently in, plus an additional fact for every 10 points of the skill check result.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Locus of Power

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** Whenever you use a Wildshaping power, you may choose to target only a single tile. Count the number of tiles in the connected area. Gain the shaping's effects once for every six shaped tiles in that area, rounded up.

### Cultivation

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** You have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Shape downtime activity.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Spreading Wilds

**Level:** 7

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Paths Unseen

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may select two shaped tiles within a six tile radius. Until the start of your next turn, these tiles are adjacent to each other. When travelling between these tiles, they are treated as if they were on the same height tier.

Among other things, this means:

- creatures may move directly from one of these tiles to another, either willingly or via forced movement
- when calculating ranges (including area of effects), count via this connection if it is shorter
- when using your wildshaping powers, if both tiles are shaped, their regions are connected

**Tile Effect:** Heavily shrouded

### Hilly Terrain

**Tile Effect:** 1 height tier block with abrupt edges. Vertically stacked blocks are adjacent to each other.

### Slippery Terrain

### Perilous Terrain

### Hazardous Terrain

**Tile Effect:** Difficult terrain and 1 stack of ailment when triggered.

### Restful Terrain

**Tile Effect:** While you are on this terrain, you have advantage on all skill checks made as part of the Recover action. All skill checks made as part of Treat actions targeting you have advantage.

### Windy Terrain

**Tile Effect:** When triggered, you must pass a difficulty 10 + Wildshaper's proficiency bonus Prowess (Athletics) skill check or be pushed one tile downwind. At the start of the wildshapers' turn, they can change the direction of the wind, affecting all tiles of this terrain at once.

### Punctuated Terrain

**Tile Effect:** 3 height tier blocks. Cannot place adjacent to each other or stack vertically. This terrain is considered connected if they are within range 2 of each other.
