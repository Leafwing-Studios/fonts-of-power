## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Weapon Bond

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** When you gain this ability, select your subclass from the list below, which determines the way in which you are connected to your weapon.

Bladesworns powers are particularly tied to their chosen weapon, and they cannot use any class features while wielding a different weapon. However, as explained by your subclass, it is nearly impossible for them to lose access to it.

Whenever a bladesworn uses the Swap action, rather than changing which set of arms they are using, instead they enter or exit a **stance**. You can only be in at most one stance at once.

Each subclass grants access to a unique stance at level 1.

### Forethought

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you spend AP, you may spend essence up to the amount of AP spent. If you do, regain 1 AP per essence spent.

Note that this can trigger multiple times per round, and works particularly well with attacks of opportunity and other reactions.

### Counterattacks

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As a bladesworn, you gain access to powers known as **counterattacks**. These may only be used as attacks of opportunity, and never cost essence.

While counterattacks use your weapon, they are special attacks: their effects scale off of Presence, not Prowess, and their attack roll is based on your Expertise, not Agility.

### Watch My Back

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Attacks of opportunity against you have disadvantage.

### Skill Memory

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** After you make a skill check, you may make a difficulty 10 Presence (Charm) skill check to convince your weapon to guide you. On a success, you may treat your result as if you were proficient in that skill. If you fail the Presence (Charm) skill check to use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a rest.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Weapon Bond: Bloodied

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you lose life due to an attack from another creature, gain a benefit determined by your subclass.

### Lead the Way

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** As a downtime activity, you may ask your weapon the direction to a specific creature, location or object. If you pass a difficulty 15 Focus (Insight) skill check, your bonded arms point the way to them until the end of your next rest, even if they move.z

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### One Step Ahead

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may move 1 tile (even if you are prone).

### Second Thought

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You have advantage on all Insight skill checks.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Thousand Cuts

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Gain access to the Thousand Cuts action.

**Thousand Cuts:** 3AP, 5 momentum. Gain the benefits of the Strike, Grapple, or one of your known counterattack actions without paying its cost. Repeat this for a total of 5 attacks. You may choose different targets for each attack, but the selected action must be the same.

After you use an action that cost AP or essence, if you hit at least one target with an attack as part of that action, gain one stack of **momentum**.
