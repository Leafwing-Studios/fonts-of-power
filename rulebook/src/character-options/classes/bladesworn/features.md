## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Weapon Bond

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** When you gain this ability, select your subclass from the list below, which determines the way in which you are connected to your weapon.

Bladesworn powers are particularly tied to their chosen weapon, and they cannot use any class features while wielding a different weapon. However, as explained by your subclass, it is nearly impossible for them to lose access to it.

Whenever a bladesworn uses the Swap action, rather than changing which set of arms they are using, instead they enter or exit a **stance**. You can only be in at most one stance at once. At the start of each of your turns, you may gain the benefit of the Swap action.

Each subclass grants access to a unique stance at level 1.

### Tempest

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you spend AP, you may spend essence equal to the AP spent. If you do, refund the AP spent.

Note that this can trigger on each creatures' turn, not just your turns. This means that it can trigger multiple times per round, and works particularly well with attacks of opportunity and other reactions.

### Counterattacks

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As a bladesworn, you gain access to powers known as **counterattacks**. These may only be used as attacks of opportunity, and never cost essence.

Counterattacks are treated as strikes using your bonded weapon in addition to their other effects.
However, they are special attacks,
so their damage is affected by your Presence, not Prowess, and their attack roll is based on your Expertise, not Agility.

### Battle Mastery

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a combat feat of your choice that grants you the ability to make attacks of opportunity in more situations.

### Skill Memory

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** After you make a skill check, you may make a difficulty 10 Presence (Charm) skill check to convince your weapon to guide you. On a success, you may treat your result as if you were proficient in that skill. If you fail the Presence (Charm) skill check to use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a rest.

### Honed Intuition

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** After your party spends a resolve, make a difficulty 20 Focus (Insight) skill check. If you succeed, gain a resolve.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Weapon Bond: Bloodied

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** The first time each turn that you lose life due to an attack from another creature, gain a benefit determined by your subclass.

### Lead the Way

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** As a downtime activity, you may ask your weapon the direction to a specific creature, location or object. If you pass a difficulty 15 Focus (Insight) skill check, your bonded arms point the way to them until the end of your next rest, even if they move.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Battle Mastery

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Gain a combat feat of your choice that grants you the ability to make attacks of opportunity in more situations.

### Second Thought

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You have advantage on all Insight skill checks.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Thousand Cuts

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Once per turn after you hit a creature with an attack, you may make an attack of opportunity against them. Then, you may spend essence equal to the AP spent on this attack of opportunity. If you do, refund the AP spent.

## Weapon Bonds

### Legendary Blade

The sword is sick as hell and has elevated its wielder.

#### Unbreakable Bond: Soulbound

Your bonded weapon can be summoned at any time, using the Interact action.
No matter where it is, it appears instantly in your hand.

#### Stance: Fluid

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and counterattacks. After you hit with either a basic attack or a counter attack, you may shift once.

#### Bloodied: Perfectionist

The first time each turn that you lose life due to an attack from another creature, the next attack you make cannot miss.
Roll as normal to determine if the attack is a critical hit.

This effect does not stack: only one "guaranteed hit" can be queued up at once.

### Ancestral Guardian

Proud bearers of the revered armaments of their lineage (genetic or otherwise), Ancestral Guardians devote themselves to the protection of the things they hold dear, guided by the wisdom of their ancestors.

#### Unbreakable Bond: Heirloom

The weapon you are bound to is spiritual in nature.
It has a clearly otherworldly nature and appears out of thin air.
You may use the Interact action to cause your bound weapon to appear in your hands or disappear completely.

#### Stance: Guarded

You have disadvantage on all attacks. You have advantage on the Block, Dodge, and Break Grapple actions.

#### Bloodied: Respite

The first time each turn that you lose life due to an attack from another creature, gain that much absorption. The absorption is gained after the life is lost.

### Cursed Blade

#### Unbreakable Bond: Cursed

No matter what you might do, you cannot get rid of the thing.
Whether you attempt to destroy it, give it away or lose it, it always reappears back in your possession by the end of your next natural rest.
Immediately after you hit a creature with an attack with another weapon (and are not wielding this weapon), it suddenly appears in your hands instead, and you later discover the other weapon stowed safely away in your belongings.

#### Stance: Bloodlust

Damage dealt to you cannot be prevented. Your critical hit threshold is reduced by 3.

#### Bloodied: Hunger

The first time each turn that you lose life due to an attack from another creature, lose an additional 2d4 life. The next attack that you hit deals extra damage equal to twice the life lost.

### Martial Artist

#### Unbreakable Bond: Bare-Handed

Your body is your weapon: you need no other and refuse to use them.

#### Stance: Wrestling

You have disadvantage on all basic attacks and counterattacks. After you hit a creature with either a basic attack or counterattack, hit them with either a Shove or Grapple attack.

#### Bloodied: Counterhit

Whenever you lose life due to an attack from another creature, you may make an attack of opportunity against them.
