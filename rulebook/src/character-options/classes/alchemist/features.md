## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Alchemy

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As an alchemist, you gain acccess to concoctions. These are potent powers that cost 3 essence, have a 3 tile range, and affect a 1 tile radius around your target. You gain access to the Catalyze action, which costs 2 AP and uses a concoction of your choice.

When you gain this feature, choose a Pursuit, which defines your subclass. When selecting concoctions, you must know more concoctions from that subclass than from any other subclass.

### Elaborate Concoctions

While the alchemist's spells are exceptionally powerful, they are more complicated to cast during combat than those of other classes. At level 1, choose one drawback for your spells from the list below. Like with all choices made as part of character creation (such as which spell you selected, the option chosen for one of your Twist class features or your attribute spread), you may change up to two of these choices each time you level up.

### Twist: Vessel

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your first metamagic choice, selected from the list of options below. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known metamagics to its effects.

These metamagic choices change how your concoctions are targeted.

### Preparations

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You may create consumables that cast one of your concoctions when you use the Devise downtime activity. You must select any twists in advance.

### Supply and Demand

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** FIXME: Ignore up to 2 points of negative loyalty towards you.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Twist: Secret Ingredient

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your second metamagic choice, determined by your subclass. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known metamagics to its effects.

This metamagic choice is strange and bursting with flavor.

### Field Research

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** Whenever your party gains a Resolve, gain the benefit of the Prepare downtime activity. You must select Anima, Fontcraft or Tinkering.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Twist: Exotic Ingredients

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your third metamagic choice, selected from the list below. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known metamagics to its effects.

This metamagic choice is more complex, and requires careful thought about how and when to use it.

### Epiphany

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** Whenever anyone in your party rolls a 20 while making a skill check outside of combat, gain a Resolve.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Pursuit: End Product

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Whenever you use the Activate action, gain a powerful effect determined by your subclass.

## Drawbacks

### Inefficient Catalyst

Your concoctions cost 6 essence instead of 3.

### Reckless Alchemy

Your concoctions are powerful but leave you open to counterattack as you pour all of your attention into drawing the required rune. Whenever you use the Catalyze action, provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like all attacks of opportunity, this attack of opportunity resolves before the triggering action (casting a spell in this case) is complete.

### Careful Mixing

Your concoctions are perfectly executed but require your careful concentration to complete. The effects of your concoctions do not trigger until the start of your next turn (although you must spend essence upfront). You must maintain concentration for this duration, or the power fails. Choose the target(s) of the spell at that time, along with any alterations.

Catalyzing a concoction in this way counts as making an attack for the purpose of the crazed ailment. For all other purposes, the attack is only made at the time of the spell's completion.

### Conduit Casting

Whenever you use the Catalyze action, lose 1 life, then gain 2 stacks of brittle. You cannot become immune to damage dealt by the brittle affliction.

### Leaky Cauldron

Whenever you use an offensive concoction, it also affects yourself.

Whenever you use a defensive or utiltiy concoction, it also affects the nearest unaffected enemy.

## Twists

### Vessel

#### Splash

Your concoction now affects a 2 tile radius cone in front of you instead.

#### Ampule

Your concoction now affects a single tile within a 6 tile range.

#### Coating

Instead of casting this concoction, apply it to the arms of an adjacent ally, including yourself. The next time they make a single-target basic attack, cast as single target, using their attack roll (against the usual defense).

#### Trap

Instead of casting this concoction, choose a tile within range 2. Create a ground effect there that casts the spell when triggered. After it is triggered, the ground effect is removed.

This effect is fleeting: it cannot be prepared outside of combat, and only persists for a minute or two.

#### Potion

Instead of casting this concoction, gain the benefit of the Treat action targeting a non-enemy creature. Apply this concoction's effect to the creature that you targeted, using the skill check result in place of an attack roll if necessary.

#### Blast

This concoction affects a 2 tile radius.

### Exotic Ingredients

#### Noxious

Whenever you would deal damage with this concoction, instead apply stacks of brittle equal to the damage that you would have dealt.

#### Homeopathic

Whenever you would apply stacks of an ailment or affliction with this concoction, instead remove that many stacks of that ailment or affliction.

#### Eclectic

At the start of combat, roll to select a random ailment. Your concoction applies stacks of that ailment instead.

Once this metamagic has been used, reroll to select the next ailment.

## Pursuits

### Eternal Life

#### Secret Ingredient: Fertile

Create a tile of difficult terrain under each tile your concoction hit.

#### End Product: Elixir of Life

Whenever you use the Activate action, regain half your life.

### Transmutation

#### Secret Ingredient: Cyclic

The elements are connected according to the diagram shown.

You may convert any elemental damage done to one of the two connected types.

#### End Product: Equivalent Exchange

Whenever you use the Activate action, you may freely select any ailments, afflictions and type of damage applied.

### Perpetual Motion

### Secret Ingredient: Inverted

The direction vector of any forced movement applied by this concoction is reversed.

For example, if the concoction would ordinarily push one target 2 tiles south, and the other 3 tiles west, they are instead pushed 2 tiles north and 3 tiles east respectively.

#### End Product: Self-Perpetuating

Whenever you use the Activate action to use one of your concoctions, instead create a tile effect at that location. When triggered, apply the effect of your concoction.

### Free Energy

#### Secret Ingredient: Supercharged

The critical hit threshold of this concoction is reduced by 5. However if you miss, it has no effect.

#### End Product: Unlimited Power

Whenever you use the Activate action, regain half your essence.
