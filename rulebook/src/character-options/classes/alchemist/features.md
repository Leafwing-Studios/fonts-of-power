## Twists

### Vessel

#### Splash

Your concoction now affects a 2 tile radius cone in front of you instead.

#### Ampule

Your concoction now affects a single tile within a 6 tile range.

#### Coating

Instead of casting this concoction, apply it to the arms of an adjacent ally, including yourself. The next time they make a single-target basic attack, cast as single target, using their attack roll (against the usual defense).

#### Trap

Instead of casting this concoction, choose a tile within range 2. Create a ground effect there that casts the spell when triggered. After it is triggered, the ground effect is removed.

This effect is fleeting: it cannot be prepared outside of combat, and only persists for a minute or two.

#### Potion

Instead of casting this concoction, gain the benefit of the Treat action targeting a non-enemy creature. Apply this concoction's effect to the creature that you targeted, using the skill check result in place of an attack roll if necessary.

#### Blast

This concoction affects a 2 tile radius.

### Exotic Ingredients

#### Noxious

Whenever you would deal damage with this concoction, instead apply stacks of brittle equal to the damage that you would have dealt.

#### Homeopathic

Whenever you would apply stacks of an ailment or affliction with this concoction, instead remove that many stacks of that ailment or affliction.

#### Eclectic

At the start of combat, roll to select a random ailment. Your concoction applies stacks of that ailment instead.

Once this metamagic has been used, reroll to select the next ailment.

## Pursuits

### Eternal Life

#### Secret Ingredient: Fertile

Create a tile of difficult terrain under each tile your concoction hit.

#### End Product: Elixir of Life

Whenever you use the Activate action, regain half your life.

### Transmutation

#### Secret Ingredient: Cyclic

The elements are connected according to the diagram shown.

You may convert any elemental damage done to one of the two connected types.

#### End Product: Equivalent Exchange

Whenever you use the Activate action, you may freely select any ailments, afflictions and type of damage applied.

### Perpetual Motion

### Secret Ingredient: Inverted

The direction vector of any forced movement applied by this concoction is reversed.

For example, if the concoction would ordinarily push one target 2 tiles south, and the other 3 tiles west, they are instead pushed 2 tiles north and 3 tiles east respectively.

#### End Product: Self-Perpetuating

Whenever you use the Activate action to use one of your concoctions, instead create a tile effect at that location. When triggered, apply the effect of your concoction.

### Free Energy

#### Secret Ingredient: Supercharged

The critical hit threshold of this concoction is reduced by 5. However if you miss, it has no effect.

#### End Product: Unlimited Power

Whenever you use the Activate action, regain half your essence.
