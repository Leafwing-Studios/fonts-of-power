## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Alchemy

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As an alchemist, you gain acccess to concoctions. These are potent powers that cost 3 essence, have a 3 tile range, and affect single target. You gain access to the Catalyze action, which costs 2 AP and uses a concoction of your choice.

### Elaborate Concoctions

While the alchemist's spells are exceptionally powerful, they are more complicated to cast during combat than those of other classes. At level 1, choose one drawback for your spells from the list below.
Like with all choices made as part of character creation (such as which spell you selected, the option chosen for one of your Twist class features or your attribute spread), you may change up to two of these choices each time you level up.

### Twist: Vessel

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your first metamagic choice, selected from the list of options below. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known twists to its effects. If the effects are contradictory, you must choose one.

This twist choice gives you options for hitting multiple creatures at once.

### Preparations

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You may create consumables that cast one of your concoctions when you use the Devise downtime activity. You must select any twists in advance.

### Snake Oil

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** When negotiating with an NPC, if you offer one of the consumables you've made, you have advantage on any skill checks made.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Twist: Process

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your second metamagic choice, selected from the list below. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known twists to its effects. If the effects are contradictory, you must choose one.

This twist choice can fundamentally alter how your conctions are applied.

Then, select an additional twist from either the Vessel or Process list.

### A Little Something Special

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** You may add a modifier to consumable concoctions that you create.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Twist: Secret Ingredient

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** Gain acccess to your third metamagic choice, selected from the list below. When you use a concoction you can choose to apply any number of your known twists to its effects. If the effects are contradictory, you must choose one.

This twist choice is more complex, and requires careful thought about how and when to use it.

Then, select an additional twist from any list.

### Mad Science

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You have advantage on skill checks made as part of the Invent downtime activity.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Perfected Recipe

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** Whenever you use the Activate action to use one of your concoctions, instead create a tile effect at that location. This tile effect lasts until the end of combat (unless otherwise removed). When triggered, it applies the effect of your concoction.

## Drawbacks

### Inefficient Catalyst

Your concoctions cost 6 essence instead of 3.

### Reckless Alchemy

Your concoctions are powerful but leave you open to counterattack as you pour all of your attention into drawing the required rune. Whenever you use the Catalyze action, provoke an attack of opportunity.

Like all attacks of opportunity, this attack of opportunity resolves before the triggering action (casting a spell in this case) is complete.

### Careful Mixing

Your concoctions are perfectly executed but require your careful concentration to complete. The effects of your concoctions do not trigger until the start of your next turn (although you must spend essence upfront). You must maintain concentration for this duration, or the power fails. Choose the target(s) of the spell at that time, along with any alterations.

Catalyzing a concoction in this way counts as making an attack for the purpose of the crazed ailment. For all other purposes, the attack is only made at the time of the spell's completion.

### Conduit Casting

Whenever you use the Catalyze action, lose 1 life, then gain 2 stacks of brittle. You cannot become immune to damage dealt by the brittle affliction.

### Leaky Cauldron

Whenever you use an offensive concoction, it also affects yourself.

Whenever you use a defensive or utiltiy concoction, it also affects the nearest unaffected enemy.

## Twists

### Vessel

#### Blast

This concoction affects a 2 tile radius. Halve the efficacy of concoctions altered in this way.

#### Spray

This concoction now affects a 2 tile radius cone in front of you. Halve the efficacy of concoctions altered in this way.

#### Hose

This concoction now affects a 6 tile line in front of you. Halve the efficacy of concoctions altered in this way.

#### Arcing

This concoction now jumps from creature to creature.
At each jump, select the closest creature (within 2 tiles) of the previous one.
This chain can contain up to three targets total.
Creatures can only be part of each chain once; you cannot return to them.
In the event of a tie, the caster may choose which creatures to affect.
Halve the efficacy of concoctions altered in this way.

### Process

#### Coating

Instead of casting this concoction, apply it to the arms of an adjacent ally, including yourself. The next time they make a single-target basic attack, cast as single target, using their attack roll (against the usual defense).

#### Trap

Instead of casting this concoction, choose a tile within range 2. Create a ground effect there that casts the spell when triggered. After it is triggered, the ground effect is removed.

This effect is fleeting: it only persists for a minute or two. Outside of combat, you may only prepare one trap in this way.

#### Potion

Instead of casting this concoction, gain the benefit of the Treat action targeting a non-enemy creature. Apply this concoction's effect to the creature that you targeted, using the skill check result in place of an attack roll if necessary.

#### Universal

The altered copcoction targets every creature on the battlefield, other than yourself. This ignores line of sight, the hidden status, and range.

### Secret Ingredient

#### Colorful

When you select this Twist, select three elemental damage types. When using this twist on a concoction, choose one of the three types selected, and convert all damage dealt to that type.

#### Fertile

Create a tile of difficult terrain under each tile your concoction hit.
If the concoction hit a single creature, it makes difficult terrain on a single tile that that creature is standing on.

#### Weirding

After you hit a creature with a concoction that uses this alteration, swap positions with them via teleportation. If you hit multiple creatures with this concoction, choose one.

#### Insidious

When you select this Twist, select an affliction. When using this twist on a concoction, convert all damage dealt into stacks of the selected affliction.

#### Excessive

The damage dealt by the altered concoction is doubled. Lose life equal to the damage you deal with the altered concoction.
