# Combat Feats

## Hot Swapping

**Effects:** After you teleport, you may gain the benefit of the Swap action.

## Arcing

**Prerequisites:** Buffer Overflow class feature

**Effects:** Your Buffer Overflow chains now have a range of 3 tiles.

## Overload

**Prerequisites:** Buffer Overflow class feature

**Effects:** You may choose to affect a radius around the target with your charges instead of chaining. Increase radius by 1 for every 2 essence spent.

## Current Draw

**Effects:** Whenever you hit a creature with an uncharged Strike action, gain the benefits of the Recover action.

## Feedback Loop

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, you may spend 1 essence to gain the benefits of the Recover action.

## Direct Current

**Effects:** You may treat charges as a melee attack. If you do, their critical hit threshold is reduced by 2.

## Circuit Breaker

**Effects:** After you see the results of an attack targeting you but before its effects are applied, you may choose to use Essence Tap as a reaction.

## Jump Instruction

**Effects:** After you use the Dodge action, you may teleport up to range 1 away.

## Memory Safety

**Effects:** After you teleport, gain absorption equal to the distance teleported.

## Garbage Collection

**Effects:** After you teleport, remove one stack of an ailment of your choice from yourself.

## GOTO

**Effects:** Whenever you would teleport, you may choose to teleport into any tile adjacent to your original target instead.

## Privilege Escalation

**Effects:** You may teleport into any tile within a 2 tile range of your target when you use Injection Attack.

## Willing Conduit

**Effects:** Whenever a creature is willingly hit by one of your charges, choose one after you see the results: refund any essence spent on that jump, or do not apply effects of the charge.

## Attack Surface

**Effects:** Your charges have a range of 6 tiles, up from 3.

## Decapacitate

**Effects:** 0 AP, 1 essence: reduce your critical hit threshold by 1 until the end of the turn.

## Exception Handling

**Effects:** Immediately after you enter death's door, immediately teleport to a tile of your choice within range 4.

## Heavily Polarized

**Prerequisites:** Alternating Current class feature

**Effects:** Polarity now grants you disadvantage on the opposite attack type. Your critical hit threshold with the favored attack type is reduced by 3.

## Oscillation

**Prerequisites:** Alternating Current class feature

**Effects:** While your polarity is postive, your attacks push creatures 1 tile away from the source of the attack. While your polarity is negative, your attacks pull creatures 1 tile closer to the source of the attack.

For clarification, the source of the attacks for chained charges is the origin of the previous jump.

## Attack Vector

**Prerequisites:** Buffer Overflow class feature

**Effects:** Lose access to your Buffer Overflow class feature: your charges can no longer be chained. You may now use charges as attacks of opportunity, and may choose to use this action to channel a charge into your weapon before using the Strike action as part of an attack of opportunity.

## Discharge

**Effects:** Whenever you use a charge, you may remove all stacks of absorption from yourself. The charge deals additional electric damage equal to the stacks of absorption removed.

### Alternating Current

**Effects:** At the start of combat, choose a **polarity**. While your polarity is positive, you have advantage on basic attacks. While it is negative, you have advantage on special attacks.

At the start of each of your turns, swap polarity. When you use the Swap action, swap your polarity.

### Short Circuit

**Effects:** Increase the range of your charges, and the range at which they jump to a nearby target by 1 tile.
Reduce the essence cost of jumping to a new target by 1.
You must jump to a new target if able.
