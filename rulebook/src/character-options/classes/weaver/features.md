## Features

### Feats

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

**Powers Known:** 4

### Weave Magic

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** As a weaver, you have access to powers known as **paterns**. To initiate a pattern, spend 2 AP to cast a pattern that you know on a single target within a 4 tile range. At the start of each of your turns, you may choose to spend two essence to **sustain** a pattern that you cast or sustained last turn.

Patterns end when any of:

- you choose to stop sustaining them
- your target is more than 8 tiles away from you
- your concentration breaks

The number of patterns that you know at any level is shown in your class table.

### Guild: Fabric of Reality

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** Select a subclass known as a **guild**: this describes what you use your mastery over the Weave to accomplish.

At level 1, you gain access to a *fabric of reality* action. This action costs 1 essence and 1 AP, and has a unique effect determined by your guild.

### Sense the Weave

**Level:** 1

**Effects:** You can sense the presence or absence of magic on any item, creature or object that you can clearly see. Learning the nature of this magic requires a successful Expertise (Fontcraft) skill check.

TODO 2022-10-23: Add guidelines for information gained from this skill check. Maybe we can make this a core part of the Fontcraft skill? Maybe instead we do a "number of questions" style design like with Scan.

### Guild: Reality Weaving

**Level:** 2

**Effects:** Gain access to a downtime activity defined by your guild.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Power Lines

**Level:** 4

**Effects:** At the end of each of your turns, roll 1d4 + 1/2 Presence. For each of your active patterns:

- add that much absorption to any allies in a line between you and the target of that pattern
- deal that much arcane damage to any enemies in a line between you and the target of that pattern

Creatures can only be affected by this ability once, regardless of how many power lines they are standing on.

### Discerning Eye

**Level:** 5

**Effects:** You immediately know what affixes magical gear and consumables possess just by looking at them.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 6

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

## Thread Twisting

**Level:** 7

**Effects:** At the start of each of your turns, you may swap the target of one of your patterns to another target within range 2 of the previous target.

### Read the Weave

**Level:** 8

**Effects:** You have advantage on all skill checks made to determine facts about the magical nature of creatures, locations, effects, or items.

### Attribute Improvement

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Increase one Attribute of your choice by 1.

### Feats

**Level:** 9

**Effects:** Gain a new combat feat and a new exploration feat.

### Mirrored Patterns

**Level:** 10

**Effects:** You learn to mirror the motions you are making with the other hand, producing two copies of the same effect. When you cast a pattern, you may choose to copy it for free. You must use the same pattern, but it does not need to target the same creature.

## Guilds

### Making

#### Fabric of Reality: Replicate

**Effects:** 1 AP, 1 essence: Create a 1 tile block within range 4. These can be destroyed via the Interact action.

#### Reality Weaving: Fabrication

**Effects:** Fabricate downtime activity. Make an appropriate skill check. You do not require materials or tools. Fixed limit on size of creation, provide a difficulty table for the complexity of the thing, non-magical items only.

### Unmaking

#### Fabric of Reality: Unravel

**Effects:** 1 AP, 1 essence: become invisible until the start of your next turn. Gain the benefits of the Hide action.

#### Reality Weaving: Annhilate

**Effects:** Downtme activity: completely destroy up to 3 cubic meters of solid material. If the material is magically imbued, you must pass an appropriate skill check. The difficulty of this skill check is determined by the power level of the item. Make a table for this.

### Space

#### Fabric of Reality: Step through the Weave

**Effects:** 1 AP, 1 essence: choose a tile within a 4 tile range. At the start of your next turn, you must teleport into that tile. Any creatures that were occupying your new tiles are pushed harmlessly aside, into an empty adjacent tile of their choice.

#### Reality Weaving: Warp and Weft

**Effects:** Downtime activity: mark a location as a place you can teleport to, or teleport your entire party to an existing marked location.

### Time

#### Fabric of Reality: Buying Time

**Effects:** 1 AP, 1 essence: as a reaction whenever you would suffer an attack, completely delay its effects. At the end of your next turn, you suffer those effects. If you delay multiple attacks in this way, they resolve in the order of your choice, they only test your concentration once, and can be blocked or dodged as a single attack.

#### Reality Weaving: Memories in the Weave

**Effects:** Downtime activity. View the full past history of an item or location of your choice. You see only the state of the item at each point in time, but not any creature interacting with it.
