# Awakened

Once ordinary animals, the awakened have been granted sentience and a more powerful form through their exposure to essence. Scattered outcasts, they band together as they explore the world and develop a culture and identity of their own that transcends their original species boundaries.

Diverse and rowdy, the awakened form an incredibly raucous group, living on the margins of most societies. They tend to be down-to-earth and kind, focused on the daily beat of existence and how to make it better for all those like them.

They come in all shapes and sizes: some bestial, and others more humanoid. No matter the animal, you can be sure that at least some have become awakened, with the capabilities to match their form.
