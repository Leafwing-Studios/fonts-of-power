# Gear

Treasure, magical trinkets, fantastical swords and elaborate suits of armor lie at the heart of the fantasy genre. *Fonts of Power* provides a robust affix system and allows players to freely flavor any items they might create, allowing your characterâ€™s gear to live up to your imagination while still integrating with the rules of the game in an interesting and fair way.

## Combat Gear

In *Fonts of Power*, there are three different types of combat-relevant items characters (and monsters!) can use:

- **Arms:** Swords, bows, wands and claws, for all your combat needs!
  - Arms enhance the power of offensive, defensive and utility actions, either mundane or magical in nature.
  - Each character can equip two sets of arms at once, and change which one they're currently using with the Swap action.
- **Armor:** Protective suits of armor, magical vestments and sleek black leather. Generally, makes you harder to kill!
  - Armor improve your defenses, protects you from conditions or makes you sneakier.
  - Each character can only equip one set of armor at once: "armor" is an entire outfit designed to function as a whole, not merely a breastplate or fancy hat.
  - You cannot change which arms or armor you have equipped in combat: changing them out is complicated work!
- **Consumables:** Powerful, one-off magical items like potions and scrolls that are consumed on use.
  - Once per combat, you can use the Activate action to use these. Using them more frequently risks exhaustion due to essence overload.
  - Player characters can create more using the Devise downtime activity.
  - As described in the Devise downtime activity, when you create more consumables, select a base effect and, optionally, a modifier from the recipes that you know.

When you make your first level 0 character, select two sets of arms and one set of armor from the Premade Gear list.

### Customizing your arms and armor

The world of *Fonts of Power* is brimming with strange and dangerous magic.
By enchanting their gear, adventurers can capture this magic in their equipment and prepare themselves to venture even deeper next time.

Gear is made by taking a **gear base** and applying **affixes** to it.

- Each piece of gear has a gear base, and supplies a **base gear point cost**
- Each affix is either an arms or armor affix, and has a specific effect that is added to the gear
- Affixes must be learned before you can apply them to your gear. All characters will know some affixes at the start of the game, but some must be discovered or found through adventuring. (Note that affixes do not need to be learned to be used, just to be applied.)
- Gear bases are very generic, and do not do much on their own
- Each affix has a gear point cost; all of these are summed together (along with the base gear point cost) to create the **gear point total** of an item

While finding or making your own enchanted equipment is essential to further success, magic can be overwhelming and dangerous for the unprepared.
When equipping gear, the **gear point total of your equipped arms and armor must be less than or equal to 6 + 2 times your proficiency bonus**.

If you have multiple sets of arms equipped, use the highest gear point total of those sets.
As a result, you'll generally want to ensure that the gear point total of each set of arms you use is the same.

Modifying gear is done using downtime activities:

- **Enchant:** Add an affix that you know to your gear. You can spend essence crystals to make this process easier.
- **Disenchant:** Salvage a piece of gear to recover some essence crystals.
- **Study:** Learn new affixes by studing a source of knowledge that you have found, be it a trinket of a defeated monster or some time with a skilled artisan.
- **Invent:** Learn new affixes by experimentation, drawing affixes from a deck.

## Trinkets

Trinkets are non-combat magical items, that can have various effects.
Unlike arms and armor, trinkets do not have a gear point cost.
You can have at most **3 trinkets equipped at once.**
Trickets can be swapped whenever you rest.
Additionally, if you find a trinket in the wild, you may immediatley swap it for one you have currently equipped.
Trinkets can be used in combat using the Activate action, although most of them will have little to no practical effect in the middle of a fight.
