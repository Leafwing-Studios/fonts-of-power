# Downtime Activities

As the party rests, characters can choose a downtime activity that they would like to spend their time doing.
Downtime represents a break in the standard action, giving characters the opportunity to spend time with each other, prepare for upcoming dangers, catch up on gear upgrades, or simply relax.
Downtime activities provide excellent opportunities to develop or reveal character and the world.

<div class="infobox">

**Extended periods of rest**

If the party is resting for an extended period in a safe location, such as while they are in town, they may continue selecting downtime activities for each rest before they return to adventuring.
If the number of rests is unclear, we recommend taking two downtime activities for the extended period of rest.
For extended rests of this nature, we recommend roleplaying small scenes, either based on the downtime activities themselves, or separate scenes in-between rests.
These scenes help to break up the monotony of numerous downtimes, and keep the world from feeling stagnant.

If the party is taking an extended rest in a dangerous area, such as an aggressive font of power, remember that each rest triggers a one success attrition scene as the party risks consequences from the nearby threat.

</div>

There are several well-defined downtime activities within the rules for players to select from, granting fairly general and tangible mechanical benefit.
While the downtime activities that follow are the most common and generically useful options, they are not intended as an exhaustive list.
Other downtime activities should offer similarly tangible benefits, in order to ensure that the choice stays meaningful.

## Danger Levels

In the world of _Fonts of Power_, some areas are incredibly dangerous, crawling with monsters and bubbling with magical power, while others, such as towns, are quite safe. This is captured in the idea of the **danger level** of an area.

Areas with a higher danger level carry more risk but come with greater rewards. The danger level of areas is always between 0 and 3, and is readily apparent to all those who enter it.

The danger level of an area affects the following:

- If you rest in an area with a danger level greater than 0, you must complete a one-success [attrition scene](rules/scenes/attrition-scenes), suffering consequences if you fail
- The difficulty of skill checks during attrition and chase scenes increases by 5 for each danger level
- The Harvest and Enchant downtime activities gain a bonus of +5 for each danger level
- Harvest can only be used if the danger level is 1 or greater
- Players can only be resurrected at a font from the area of highest danger. In most cases, this is the physical center of the font.
- The difficulty of combat encounters and the amount of treasure found scales with the danger level, as described in the [_Worldspeaker's Guide to Fonts of Power_](http://worldspeakers.fontsofpower.com/#/)

## Bond

Grow closer to another party member, improving your cooperation.
Both party members must select this downtime activity in order to gain its benefits.

Until you next complete a rest:

- you have advantage on any skill check made to attempt to help each other on skill checks
- you have advantage on any skill checks or attack rolls made to use the Treat or Break Grapple actions to benefit each other
- while the other is in your zone of control, you may Block attacks targeting them, taking the attack's effects

## Challenge

Challenge an NPC to a contest of some sort, wagering that your skill is superior, and winning or losing the stakes of your bet based on the outcome. Mechanically:

1. Propose a method of contest for both you and the NPC, selecting both a skill and an attribute.
2. Propose a set of stakes for both you and the NPC.
3. Borrowing rules from the Deals and Ideals section found in the Scenes chapter, the NPC evaluates this challenge’s payoff and plausibility, accepting the challenge if their sum is at least 0.
   - You may use both Deception and Salesmanship to influence their perception of the payoff and plausibility.
4. Make an opposed skill check against the NPC.
5. If you win, you gain your half of the stakes of your bet. If you lose, hand over the stakes of the bet or their loyalty to you decreases by 1 or 2 due to Broken Trust.
6. If you win by 5 or more their loyalty towards you increases by 1, as you Earn Their Respect due to your superior skill. If you lose by 5 or more, their loyalty towards you decreases by 1 as you lose their respect through your abject failure.

## Connect

Improve your relationship with an NPC or faction by helping them out or building social ties.
If you succeed on a suitable difficulty 15 skill check, their loyalty increases by 1.

It's harder to win the trust of your enemies: add their current loyalty to your skill check result.

## Craft

Attempt to fashion something useful from the materials you have.
Make an Expertise (Tinkering) skill check. For every 5 points of the skill check result, you may make a _prepared for anything_ check to attempt to create an item of your choice.

The plausibility of these checks is increased by 1.

Like usual, if you roll a 1 on the supplies die, deplete it once.

## Disenchant

Scrap an enchanted item completely, turning it back into its raw ingredients.

Choose an enchanted set of arms or armor, and make an Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check.
Choose one of its affixes, and gain that ingredient.
It is associated with the skill used for this check.
Gain one essence crystal for each remaining enchantment point of the item, up to a maximum of one essence crystal for every 5 points of your skill check result.

## Devise

Create a small batch of consumable magic items for your party to use out of whatever you might have on hand, powered by their user’s own essence. These might be healing potions, a poison to coat your weapon with or a clever trap.

Design a consumable by selecting one base effect and up to one modifier.
You must know the recipes in some way, choosing to either:

- Use a recipe you already know.
  - Recipes are sometimes found as treasure, or as rewards from helping others.
  - You can learn new recipes as part of the Invent downtime activity.
  - Allies can share their recipes with you by using the Support downtime activity.
- Reverse-engineer a new recipe.
  - Sacrifice one existing consumable to use either its base effect or modifier in the consumable you are creating.

Make a Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check.
Some modifiers are skill exclusive: you must use the corresponding skill when using these recipes.
Create one copy of the consumable for every 5 points of your skill check result.
Sacrifice one essence crystal for each consumable created.

After you create a consumable, learn all recipes used in it.

## Enchant

Enchant an item, adding an affix to it.

Choose a set of arms or armor, and then choose one of the following options to determine which affix is added:

- Use an ingredient that you have scavenged from a monster to add this affix to that item.
  - After each victorious combat encounter, each party member draws three affixes used by the monsters, and chooses one to keep as an ingredient.
  - The skill used is determined by the type of monster it was from.
- Use an ingredient harvested from the current Font (including those found using the Harvest downtime activity)
  - The skill is the same that was used for the Harvest downtime activity
- Use a reusable ingredient from another source. This might be a book from the library, the assistance of a craftsman in town, a scroll found in a chest, etc.
  - The skill used is given by the ingredient.
  - These ingredients are not consumed, although the owner may want it back!

Consume the ingredient, then determine your success or failure at this crafting:

- Make an Expertise skill check using the appropriate crafting skill (one of Anima, Fontcraft or Tinkering).
- Add 5 times the current danger level of the area you are resting in to the result.
- The difficulty of adding an affix is equal to 15 + (5 \* the gear points of that affix).

You have disadvantage on this skill check if you used a skill other than the one associated with the ingredient used.
The item that you create becomes associated with the skill you used to enchant: when it is disenchanted you will receive an ingredient of that type.

If you succeeded, you may choose to remove any number of existing affixes from that gear, then add your new affix!

If you failed by 10 or less, you may sacrifice essence crystals equal to the difference between your roll and the difficulty to complete the process.

If you failed by more than 10, your downtime activity is wasted and you lose the ingredient.

## Harvest

Gather resources from the environment around you.

For example, you might hunt for glowing mushrooms with Anima, tap into the font’s power directly using Fontcraft, or salvage scraps of machinery using Tinkering.

1. Choose one of Anima, Fontcraft or Tinkering.
2. Make a Focus skill check with the chosen skill, adding a bonus of 5 times the danger level of the area you are resting in.
3. Then draw one random ingredient from the font or town's collection of affix ingredients for every 5 points of the skill check result.
4. Finally, either choose one to keep or gain 1 essence crystal for every 5 points of your skill check result.
The ingredient gained is associated with the skill you used for this skill check.

## Invent

Tinkering with magic, you attempt to create new and wonderful magical contraptions.

Make an Expertise (Anima), Expertise (Fontcraft) or Expertise (Tinkering) skill check.
Choose one of the following recipe decks to draw from:

- universal recipes
- font-specific recipes associated with the font of power you are currently in
- skill-specific recipes

You can look through the universal and skill-specific recipe decks before deciding, but the font-specific deck is secret.

Draw one consumable recipe (which may be a base effect or modifier) at random for every 5 points of your skill check results and choose which one to keep.
Shuffle any recipes you did not choose back into the deck.

## Prepare

Read a book, hone a talent, sharpen your weapon, practice magic, gather information from the locals, scout the area or so on.
Once before the end of your next rest, after you see the result of an attack roll or skill check that you have made that is directly related to the training you performed, you may instead treat that attack roll or skill check as if you’d rolled a 15 instead.

## Recover

Focus on rest and enjoy yourself.

Remove an additional stack of exhaustion.

## Resupply

Purchase supplies, borrow them from the locals or scavenge them from the surrounding environment.

Choose one of the following skill checks to make, depending on the setting of your downtime activity:

- Presence (Charm)
- Focus (Anima)
- Focus (Fontcraft)
- Focus (Tinkering)

Then, reset the party's Supplies die based on the result of the check:

- 10 or lower: d4
- 11-15: d6
- 16-19: d8
- 20-24: d10
- 25 or higher: d12

The details of how and where you last resupplied influence the plausibility of having various useful pieces of equipment; it’s trivial to find firewood in the middle of a dark forest but quite hard to come across a new set of lock-picks.
See the Prepared for Anything section for more details on how Supply and adventuring gear works.

## Resurrect

<div class="infobox">

**Deadlier Death**

In less optimistic campaigns, the lurking threat of death serves an important narrative role, creating fear and raising the stakes.
If your table wants to play _Fonts of Power_ in such a fashion, we recommend four, progressively more brutal options:

- Increase the difficulty of the skill check made to Resurrect creatures to 20 + your transcendence.
This limits its availability significantly, especially at lower levels.
- Remove the Resurrect downtime activity completely. This keeps dead characters dead. You should probably have a back-up character ready...
- Creatures cannot choose to slip safely unconscious while at death's door; their fate is left entirely to the dice. Hopefully your allies can end the fight soon.
- Do not match the proficiency bonus of the monster to the level of the party, or the number of turns per round to the number of players in the party. Instead, just put in monsters that make sense for the environment at the time. You did notice the rules for _Chase Scenes_, right?

</div>

Death is not always the end of the story. Fonts of power capture souls as they depart the bodies of the fallen, swirling in the magical vortex before they are completely absorbed.
If their allies are quick and skilled however, they can coax that soul back into a new (or old) form, allowing them to fight another day.

Whenever a creature dies while at a font of power, they start to become one with its magical energy, eventually becoming absorbed.
Each time the party benefits from a rest (including from Resolve) or fails a resurrection check, the dead creature gains one stack of **transcendence,** which represents the gradual absorption of their soul by the font.
Whenever you gain a stack of transcendence that increases your transcendence to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Focus, you must make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check with a difficulty of 10 + your current transcendence.
If you fail, you disappear as your spirit slips away forever.

As a downtime activity, your allies can attempt to **Resurrect** you.
In order to use the Resurrect downtime activity, they must be in the area with the highest danger level of the font that absorbed you.
Additionally, they must have an adequate **vessel**, as described in the table below.
They then must succeed on three separate skill checks, with a difficulty of 10 + your transcendence.
These skill checks always use Focus, but the skill used (and the species you reincarnate as) varies based on the vessel used.

**Resurrection Options**

| Species                      | Vessel                                  | Skill required |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Original                     | Original body                           | Medicine       |
| Undead (Eternal or Skeleton) | Another body                            | Medicine       |
| Fontborn                     | A badly damaged body                    | Fontcraft      |
| Awakened                     | An ordinary animal                      | Anima          |
| Undead (Spectre) or Slime    | None                                    | Fontcraft      |
| Automata                     | An inanimate object                     | Tinkering      |
| Sylvan                       | A plant                                 | Anima          |
| Crystalline                  | 10 essence crystals                     | Fontcraft      |
| Fae                          | Something from a wild place             | Anima          |
| Reclaimer                    | Something with a strong memory attached | Fontcraft      |

**Resurrection Example**

Consider the scenario where 4 party members are attempting to resurrect a dead ally.
Firstly, the party must acquire a vessel and journey into the most dangerous part of the font.
They choose to use the original body, but they take two days to travel to the font's center, fighting progressively tougher monsters on the way.

Finally, they reach the center of the font, which is a danger level of 3.
When the party arrives, their ally has 2 transcendence.
They have a focus score of 2, so do not risk burning away until they reach 9 transcendence (7 + 2 = 9).

The party immediately starts getting to work resurrecting their ally.
They decide to all take the Resurrect downtime activity, for a total of 4 attempts. Because of the current transcendence and the chosen vessel, they all roll Focus (Medicine) against a difficulty of 12. After rolling, there are 2 successes and 2 failures. The two failures increase the target's transcendence to 4.

Then, because the party is in a danger level of 3 while trying to rest, they must perform a single-success attrition scene with a difficulty of 25.
Unfortunately, the party fails, and they are forced into a tough fight by their worldspeaker.

After the dust has settled, the party completes their rest, and the target's transcendence increases one last time to 5.
The next day, they all try to resurrect again, but this time against a difficulty of 15. They get their final success, reviving their dead ally.

Their ally returns as their original species with 5 stacks of exhaustion.
Then, the party completes one last attrition scene as before, which they succeed without consequences. With their task completed, they return to a safer area to take a few days of rest.

</div>

Each ally may make take the Resurrect downtime activity during the same rest.
This can dramatically increase speed and success rate, but remember that the target gains transcendence after each failure.
As always, they must all chose whether to Resurrect _before_ any allies have rolled to see if they succeed.
Then, all allies roll at the same time, tallying up successes and failures appropriately.

When you return from the dead, you immediately suffer exhaustion equal to your previous transcendence.
Like usual, gaining this exhaustion can kill you. Any skill checks made to resurrect you after you have died due to the exhaustion of being brought back from the dead are made with disadvantage.

## Shape

Attempt to shape the world around you, preparing an arena for combat.
Make an Expertise skill check using Anima, Fontcraft or Tinkering.

For every 2 points of your skill check result, you may add or remove one standard vantage corresponding to the skill that you used to the arena you are currently resting at.

Fontcraft and Anima does not have a standard list of vantages; instead use the ones listed by the font you are currently in.

## Support

Help your allies with their downtime tasks.
Make a Focus (Guidance) skill check, enabling some of your allies to either perform two downtime activities, rather than just one.
The number of characters you can support in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down.
Characters cannot benefit from this effect more than once per downtime, and cannot select either the Recover or Support downtime activities during a period of downtime where they benefit from this effect.

Characters who you assist in this way can use any of the recipes that you know as part of the Devise downtime activity.

## Tend

Attempt to tend to illnesses and fatigue.
Make a Focus (Medicine) skill check, attempting to speed the healing of some of your allies.
The number of characters you help in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down. Creatures that you help, gain the benefit of the Recover downtime activity.
