# Trickery Scenes

Whether you’re talking your way past some guards with a forged set of papers, pulling off an elaborate heist, or infiltrating an enemy fortress, deceiving your enemies can lead to some fantastic stories.

Whenever the party finds themselves caught up in a harebrained scheme that involves a **risk of getting caught,** switch to a trickery scene to capture the drama of the moment in a fun and transparent way.

As the **scoundrels** in the scene, your job is to complete whatever goal you have before the **suspicion** of the **guards** gets too high. There are four levels of suspicion, which escalate whenever you fail a **risky** skill check and make taking further risks more dangerous.

- **Oblivious:** You have advantage on risky skill checks.
- **Suspicious:** Roll normally when making risky skill checks.
- **Paranoid:** You have disadvantage on risky skill checks.
- **Detected:** You’ve been caught!

The starting level of suspicion should be set and communicated by the worldspeaker according to the NPC’s state: it’s much harder to pull one over a guard when they’re arresting you than when they’re relaxing at the pub.

Risky skill checks might include:

- Trying to pickpocket an item using Agility (Trickery)
- Sneaking past a guard with Agility (Stealth)
- Attempting to convince a wealthy noble to check out your counterfeit wares with Presence (Charm)
- Looking for incriminating documents on a bureaucrat's desk using Focus (Perception)
- Grilling a noble for information at a party with Focus (Insight)

While you’re pulling off your plan, your allies can help out by creating **distractions.**
Resolve distractions by making an opposed skill check, with the attributes and skills in question set according to the details of the distractions:

- **Success:** Reduce suspicion once.
- **Failure:** The guards Scan for you, making an opposed skill check. Increase suspicion once if they succeed.

Distractions only work when they’re unexpected; you cannot use the same distraction twice in a single trickery scene. Some distractions might include:

- Showing off a great feat of strength at a party with Prowess (Athletics)
- Giving a sermon to a rapt audience using Presence (Guidance)
- Sabotaging the stage with Expertise (Tinkering)
- Engaging in pleasant conversation with Presence (Charm)
- Faking a dramatic injury using Presence (Medicine)
