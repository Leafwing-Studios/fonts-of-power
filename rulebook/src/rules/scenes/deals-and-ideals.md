# Deals and Ideals

When one character wants something of another, a **deal** must be struck.
Each side of the negotiation is referred to as a **party**.
This could be a single individual, a group, or a negotiator acting on behalf of a group.

There are two phases in the process of making deals:

1. **The pitch:** one party proposes a deal, and the other party evaluates the deal
2. **Haggling:** the reactive party responds to the deal. Counteroffers and persuasion occurs until either the deal is made or someone walks away.

## The Pitch

After spending some time determining what each side wants and what each side can provide, one party (usually the player characters) proposes a specific deal: if the other party does X, they will do Y in return.
At this point, the worldspeaker determines the **willingness** of any non-player parties:

1. **Unwilling:** the party is unwilling under any circumstances
2. **Begrudging:** the party is unwilling, but will tell the active party what, if anything would be needed for them to agree
3. **Lukewarm:** the party is willing to agree to the deal, but on a condition of their choosing
4. **Interested:** the party is willing to agree to the deal as it's proposed
5. **Excited:** the party is very interested in the deal, and wants to go above and beyond the original terms

The NPC party's willingness cannot start at level 5, only levels 1-4.
When determining the willingness of the NPC party, make sure to consider:

- The potential gain/loss for the party
- The likelyhood that the players will be able to hold up their end of the deal
- The moral implications of the deed being done, and the ideals of the NPC
- The loyalty that the two parties have towards each other (or any bitter rivalries!)
- How other parties may react to the deal

## Haggling

Now that the deal has been evaluated, both parties work to make the deal better for them.
During standard haggling, either party may propose a change to the deal or it's terms.
Some examples include:

- Increasing or decreasing payment for work done
- Putting up some collateral upfront
- Adding additional requirements on what must be completed
- Adding additional restrictions on how tasks can be completed
- Promises to also do future work
- Restricting making deals with specific other parties for a period of time

In addition to regular haggling, the players may attempt to **persuade** any NPC parties.
In this case, make an appropriate difficulty 20 skill check.
Some examples include:

- Using Presence (Guidance) to appeal to the moral benefits of completing the deal
- Using Expertise (Any appropriate) to demonstrate the party's competence at relevant tasks
- Using Presence (Trickery) to lie about potential riches and rewards
- Using Presence (Charm) to increase their loyalty towards the party
- Using Prowess (Athletics) to intimidate the other party into agreeing

Then, based on the result of this check:

- **Failure:** Increase the difficulty of future checks to make this deal by 5, cumulatively. (Soft failures can still succeed at a cost or gain an opportunity)
- **Simple success:** Increase the willingness of the other party by 1 level
- **Smashing success:** Increase the willingness of the other party by 2 levels

If you succeed on this check, you cannot make another one for the remainder of the scene.
However, persuading the othe party gets harder the more times you fail.
Choose your skill checks wisely!
As an example, after only two failures, the cumulative difficulty will be 30, making a success only possible with a natural 20 *and* a fully maxed out skill.
After three failures, the skill check is impossible, no matter what you do.

## Resolution

After the haggling phase is complete, the reactive party either accepts the deal (perhaps after some ammendments), or walks away.
Any parties which made commitments must uphold those commitments.
If they fail to do so, they will have to deal with the consequences of spurning their partner.
