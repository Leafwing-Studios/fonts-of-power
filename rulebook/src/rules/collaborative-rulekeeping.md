# Collaborative Rulekeeping

In _Fonts of Power,_ **everyone plays within the framework of the rules of the game on the same terms.**
Adjudicating rules, and making any changes to them, is the responsibility of the table as a whole, as is the interpersonal burden of resolving conflicts and actually running the game.

As a player, in contrast to other systems you might be familiar with, this gives you more freedom, but comes with added responsibility:

- **Learn the rules** of the game, especially those that your character uses directly.
- **Step up to organize,** host and run game sessions.
- **Play fair** for the sake of everyone’s fun. Abusing an exploit can be fun for a moment, but quickly grows stale, especially for everyone else at the table.
- _Fonts of Power_ is designed to be fun and rewarding for players who love mastering systems and playing hard.
  - The systems in place deliberately make it very challenging to become all-powerful (or accidentally very weak) in a generic sense.
  - Instead, if you enjoy optimizing character builds, we recommend focusing on a specific style of play or thematic vision, and then trying to create the best version of that ideal that you can.
- **Don’t try to deliberately break your worldspeaker’s story or world** for out-of-game reasons. Be respectful of their domain, just as they are respectful of your domain over your character.
  - If you have a clever solution to a puzzle, fight or social encounter, feel free to dive in!
  - But if you have concerns about their content or techniques, talk about it with them maturely and directly, rather than trying to make a point in game.
- **Speak up** when you think a rule or piece of content isn’t working, you’re uncomfortable, or you’re simply not having fun.
- Be creative, and if you have an idea that you can’t find a home for, try to **homebrew** a balanced and interesting content or rules.
  - This system has lots of **hooks** for your mechanics, and balance guidelines and examples to go with them.
  - As a result, it’s much easier to safely and meaningfully hack than other systems you may be familiar with.
  - Think about balance from the perspective of someone else at your table: would you be frustrated with a mechanic, concerned about its power level, or happy about the cool things it enables?
  - Talk to your table and get them on board before you throw in new homebrew content.

If you’re a worldspeaker reading this section and want more advice on how this works from your side of the table, check out the corresponding section in the [_Worldspeaker’s Guide to Fonts of Power_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WLBeS_Ei_BJYZnBafG6rWf7xODPFDSz8RQV2iA3WCU/edit#heading=h.49ykof8w292g).

## Guidelines for Rules

While playing the game, try to make fast, simple and approximate rulings that prioritize getting the game moving without feeling unfair or breaking immersion.
Playing the game and telling your stories is more important than getting the rules right, at least until it becomes a recurring issue or is a clear exploit.

_Fonts of Power_ is equipped with a robust design and balance framework, with the specific intent of allowing players and worldspeakers to create new content that matches their fantasies without requiring expert skill or repeated iteration to get a workable approximation of what they’d imagined.
Making changes to the features of a class, species or affix (or inventing new ones entirely), or changing the details of how specific rules work can be proposed by anyone at the table.
The _Hacker's Guide to Fonts of Power_ book goes into this in substantially more detail, and is an excellent resource for players and worldspeakers looking to move past the content that is officially published.

When dealing with details of plot, be careful when changing details that have already been described (or bending rules for narrative reasons). Communicate what’s changing in order to get buy-in from the rest of the table, in order to make sure that the stories can be kept straight and ensure that the world feels consistent and reasonable.

If you're unsure of how a rule or interaction should work, the following principles capture the intended spirit of rule adjudication within the system:

- **Fun and interesting choices come first.** Realism is important only in that it allows for immersion in the world.
- **Unfair exploits don’t work:** while synergy is intended, nothing comes for free or creates unlimited power.
- **Specific rules beat general ones.**
- **Every option presented should be genuinely useful,** at least sometimes.
  - This also requires that no option be overwhelmingly strong.
  - Conditional power is a great tool here.
- **Effects intended as an improvement or penalty should work as such,** unless there’s a clear reason why they don’t.
  - Working around limitations or drawbacks should come with a cost in some form, or require specific and narrow circumstances.
  - Previous features, especially skills, should not be invalidated completely.
  - Interactions should be handled gracefully. Similar effects stack with each other, but do so additively. Advantage and disadvantage are a notable exception to this rule.
  - Absorption and damage dealt can never be negative.
- **Do not add flat bonuses or penalties to attack rolls or skill checks:** bounded accuracy is important for making sure everything can interact safely. Advantage and disadvantage, or complications to the outcomes are typically a much better way to handle this
- **Use flavor text for flavor purposes.** Flavor text is incredibly malleable based on player preference, but does not overrule specific rules text, especially in combat.
- If effects trigger off of each other, they are resolved in a **first-in, last-out order.**
- If there is a series of effects that are applied in an ambiguous order, **the order is determined by the originator of those effects.**
  - As a common example, the wielder of a weapon can determine the order that the weapon’s affixes are applied in.
  - If the effects are controlled by different sources, they resolve in the order of the turn order, beginning with the character whose turn it is. If that fails, the effects resolve alphabetically.
- Unless otherwise stated, **round up.**
