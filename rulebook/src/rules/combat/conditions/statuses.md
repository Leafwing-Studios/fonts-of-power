# Statuses

## Death's Door

While you are at 0 life, you are at **death’s door**.
At the start of each of your turns while on death’s door, you must choose whether to slip safely into unconsciousness or to stay conscious.

While conscious and at death’s door, you must maintain your concentration at all times, lest your soul be consumed by the nearest fonts.
Whenever you would lose life, instead make a difficulty 15 concentration check, using Presence (Endurance):

- **Failure by 5 or more:** you die.
- **Failure by less than 5:** you slip into unconsciousness, and gain a stack of exhaustion.
- **Success by less than 5:** you stay conscious, but gain a stack of exhaustion.
- **Success by 5 or more:** you stay conscious.

Like always, you have a penalty to all skill checks equal to your current stacks of exhaustion, including skill checks made to maintain your concentration.

Once combat (and other intense activities such as Chase Scenes) have ended, you automatically slip into unconsciousness as the adrenaline (or its strange analog) fades.

At that point, other creatures can attempt to rouse you with a Focus (Medicine) skill check.
The difficulty of this skill check is 10 + the number of stacks of exhaustion that the unconscious creature has.

If this skill check succeeds, you regain consciousness and stabilize at 1 life.
If this fails, or if no one attempts to rouse you, you instead regain consciousness and heal (regaining half your life like usual) when the party next completes a rest.

## Flying

If you have the ability to fly, you can spend half your movement to take flight. While flying:

- You do not take falling damage.
- Melee attacks made against you have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- If you cannot spend movement or are knocked prone you stop flying.
- You are immune to the effects of the aloft ailment.

You may stop flying at any point during your turn by spending 1 tile of movement.

**This is not a flight simulator**

In this game, flying (as part of combat) is deliberately unrealistic, optimizing for fun and interesting gameplay that captures some of the fun of flight in fantasy combat without destroying the game’s balance or grinding combat to a halt.

If you find yourself worrying about whether you can outrange the archers on the ground, or how movement speeds work when you are in fact travelling in 3 dimensions, or whether your character can really fly while wearing a full suit of armor: you’re probably operating at the wrong level of abstraction.
Be generous to the players and monsters who have invested in the ability to fly, and don’t use combat rules to resolve scenes that don’t have interesting combat counterplay.

Falling damage is determined on a per-scene basis due to **vantages** present in the environment (see the section on Environmental Complications later in this chapter).
Rather than worrying about the biomechanics of coconut-laden swallows, and the amount of damage that said coconut would suffer when dropped from a tremendous height (and the damage that a hapless victim would suffer as it landed on their head), relax and enjoy the fiction and fun of the game for its own sake!

## Grappled

You cannot spend movement.

Creatures who are grappling each other are treated as a single entity for the purpose of forced movement.
The efficacy of single-target forced movement effects is halved.

You cannot make Grapple attacks or use the Dodge reaction.

## Grappling

This status (and the grappled status of the creature you are grappling) ends as soon as you are no longer adjacent to the creature you are grappling.

Creatures who are grappling each other are treated as a single entity for the purpose of forced movement.
The efficacy of single-target forced movement effects is halved.

If you are flying, creatures that you are grappling are also flying.

You cannot make Grapple attacks or use the Dodge reaction.

## Hidden

While hidden:

- you do not impose disadvantage on ranged attacks to creatures in your zone of control
- enemies cannot target you with single target effects

The hidden status ends when:

- another creature successfully reveals you with the Spot action
- you end your turn in a tile that is not an eligible hiding spot (see the Hide action)
- you use an action targeting a non-allied creature

When the hidden status ends, you gain the **ambush** boon until the end of the current turn.

**Ambush**: You have advantage on all attacks.

Some affixes make use of the ambush keyword to provide additional benefits.

## Invisible

You are invisible to all other creatures, causing single-target attacks against you to be made with disadvantage.

Hiding places are always veiled for you.

## Prone

You have disadvantage on basic attacks.

Grapple attacks and melee basic attacks have advantage against you, and ranged basic attacks suffer disadvantage.

Leaving a tile while prone costs an additional tile of movement.
This does not stack with the effect of difficult terrain.

## Unconscious

You cannot spend or gain AP.
You cannot spend essence.
You do not have a zone of control.
You cannot benefit from any of your senses.
