# Time and Space

## Starting Combat

When it becomes clear that a fight is inevitable, combat begins.

The players and the worldspeaker place thier characters and monsters on the map, based on their locations when the fight broke out.
Then, every character (players and mosters) is assigned a **turn order card**, which are shuffled together.

## Turn Order

At the beginning of each **round** shuffle the turn order cards together face down into a deck.
Then, at the end of each **turn** flip up the top card to determine whose turn it is to act.
When the deck is empty, the round ends and the deck is reshuffled.
During the last character's turn; a player (or worldspeaker) who is not acting should shuffle the deck to avoid delays in play.

Note that the back of the turn order cards reveal whether the next actor is a player or a monster.
You can use that information to your advantage, especially as the deck runs low!

Particularly powerful monsters tend to take **multiple turns per round.** Add one turn order card for that monster to the deck for each turn it takes per round.

### Surprise Rounds

Sometimes, one side gets the jump on the other, either by hiding or suddenly lashing out with violence.
When this happens, prepare the turn order like normal. During the first round, creatures which were surprised skip their turn.

Typically, an entire side will be surprised, but sometimes, such as when one character spots a hidden monster at the last moment, they will act while the rest of their allies do not.

## Controlling Space

Keeping yourself safe from someone trying to stab you requires a great deal of active attention.

Every creature has a **zone of control,** by default the tiles that it is immediately adjacent to.

Whenever you **enter and leave an opponentâ€™s zone of control in the same turn,** you provoke an **attack of opportunity,** leaving your guard down as you scramble to get past them.
When this happens, they may make an attack of their choice against you, spending action points and essence as usual.
This is not limited to basic attacks: they may choose to hold you in place with a Grapple attack, trip you using the Shove action or even blast you with a spell.
