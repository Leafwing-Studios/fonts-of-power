### Strike (2 AP)

Strike at your target with your currently equipped set of arms.
Make a basic attack against a creature or object within range of your current arms.

By default, basic attacks deal 1d8 + Prowess physical damage.

## Defense

### Block (1 AP, reaction)

Whenever you would be hit by an attack (after seeing the initial results of the attack), you may use the Block reaction.

If you do, make a Prowess (Athletics) skill check:

- if your skill check result is at least 10, you **block** all attacks made against you until the end of the current turn
- if your skill check result is at least 20, regain any AP spent

The efficacy of blocked attacks is halved. Like always, round up.

### Break Grapple (1 AP)

Attempt to break another creatureâ€™s hold on a target, ending the grappled status on yourself or another creature within 1 tile of you.

To do so, make an opposed Prowess (Athletics) skill check against the grappling creature. If you succeed, the grapple ends.

### Defend (1 AP)

Gain 6 + Presence absorption.

### Dodge (1 AP, reaction)

Whenever you would be hit a basic attack, Grapple attack or Shove attack (after seeing the initial results of the attack), you may use the Dodge reaction.
If you do, make an Agility (Athletics) skill check.
If your skill check result is greater than or equal to the attack roll that hit you, **dodge** the attack.
Attacks that you dodge are treated as if the attacker missed.

### Treat (1 AP)

Attempt to treat the maladies of a creature within a 1 tile range, curing a single ailment or mitigating a single affliction of your choice.
You are always within range of yourself, and so can target yourself with this action.

Select a ailment or affliction. If you succeed on a difficulty 10 Focus (Medicine) skill check, remove all stacks of an ailment or half the stacks, rounded up, of an affliction of your choice from your target. On a smashing success, remove all stacks of that affliction instead.

### Ward (1 AP)

The first time before the start of your next turn that you would gain any stacks of an ailment or affliction, ignore all ailments and afflictions that would be applied by that effect.

If you use this action multiple times in a single turn, you prevent a second (or third or..) set of ailments or afflictions from being applied to you.
