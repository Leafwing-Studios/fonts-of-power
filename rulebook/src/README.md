# Introduction

_Fonts of Power_ is a d20 tabletop roleplaying game system, designed to capture the wonder of exploring magical places.
Teeming with magic, **fonts of power** have three defining characteristics: they are **dangerous**, **interesting**, and **magical.**

As a **player** in _Fonts of Power,_ you will delve deep into these fonts as you seek your fortune, fight for your ideals, win allies, and learn more about the wonderous world in front of you.

When you drive the story forward and opt into risk, you will earn **Resolve.**
This powerful meta-currency can be used to recover from unlucky mistakes or to find the strength to press on to meet the challenges you’ve chosen to face.

As you adventure, you’ll find moments to catch your breath and reap the rewards of your escapades, and each party member gains access to a **downtime activity.**
These moments of calm are precious and valuable, giving you the chance to recover from your injuries, prepare for what's to come, forge meaningful bonds with NPCs, enchant your own magical items and more.

## The World

The species, classes and other details described in this book paint a picture of a vibrant and diverse setting full of magic and budding technology that puts an optimistic steampunk twist on classic fantasy themes.

The world of _Fonts of Power_ is a wondrous place: thriving and vibrant, but dotted with places of great and terrible magical power.
Magic is the very essence of life: imbuing plants and animals with sentience, calling strange creatures into existence, and bringing the very land itself alive with wild and ancient power.
As it concentrates, it coalesces into valuable **essence crystals** that serve as the currency of adventurers across the land.
Left unchecked, the magic feeds upon itself, swallowing the very land as it becomes a dangerous font of power.

Every creature is, in some form, imbued with this magic.
As adventurers grow in power, they must master the intricacies of their own source of magic and learn to control its dangerous excesses.
Through their adventures, they discover, create, and earn magical **gear,** letting them focus, refine, and revise their capabilities as the situation demands.

At the heart of the action, fonts of power overflow with vibrant magic, teeming with strange **monsters**.
Seeded by a concentration of magical power, whether it was an erupting volcano, a sacred temple, or the remains of a terrible magical disaster, they amplify its character and contents into something truly fantastical.

Intentionally or incidentally, monsters serve as the hands, eyes and immune system of the fonts of power.
Born from or drawn to its energy, they defend it from intruders, expand its domain, and turn those foolish enough to venture into the heart of the font back into the raw magic needed to fuel its growth.

Civilizations and fonts of power exist in an uneasy symbiosis: the people of the world exploit the fonts’ incredible power while the fonts feed on the magic of the countless souls lost to their hazards and inhabitants.
Gritty frontier towns rise and fall as they eke out a dangerous but lucrative business supplying the cities with the magical resources they need to support their burgeoning technology.

Over the ages, fonts of power (and the factions that make up the civilizations) slowly grow and change, acting as living organisms on a nearly unimaginable scale. As they invade, defend and compete with each other they leave fragments of the past behind: **treasures, threats** and **clues** for adventurers like you to discover.

In the world where the dungeons themselves want you dead, **why do you explore?**

**Playing Fonts of Power in other settings**

This system is purposefully designed to be adapted to your favorite settings and genres.
When thinking about “what would a font of power be in my world?” come back to those three characteristics: dangerous, interesting and magical.

These are the critical ingredients needed to make sure places can serve as memorable backdrops for adventure.
Fonts of power might be as small as a dragon’s lair, or sprawling as an untamed wilderness.
They may be inhospitable alternate realities, or they could be a bustling city, brimming with crime, magic and intrigue.

Fonts of power serve as thematic glue for the system, pushing your party towards adventure. All you need is a reason for players to want to explore them, and then add challenges to make doing so interesting.

## How to Use This Compendium

This compendium is divided into two sections: [Rules](/rules/) and [Character Options.](/character-options/).
The Rules section contains the basic rules of the game, and is intended to be referenced at the table. The Character Options section covers everything you need to know to make your own characters in _Fonts of Power._

_Fonts of Power_ is a d20 system, broadly similar to _Pathfinder_ or modern _Dungeons & Dragons._
If you’ve played those before, many of our core dice mechanics should feel familiar, so that you can focus on learning the things that make our system unique.

**If you’re new to tabletop roleplaying games,** you should read the [Building Blocks of Play](intro/building-blocks.md) chapter coming up next, which introduces the core concepts needed to understand the rest of the rules.

**If you’re familiar with other d20 systems,** you can safely skip that chapter, and start with the [Narrative Mechanics](rules/narrative-mechanics/) chapter.
If you’d prefer to dive straight into character creation, the rules for character creation are at the very beginning of the second half of the book, entitled [Character Options](character-options/).

Regardless of your experience level with other systems, we encourage you to play your first session at level 0: the core mechanics are surprisingly rich and it makes both learning the game and creating characters much less overwhelming.

Following that, you can find your choices for your **species, class, talents,** and **gear.** You should copy down these choices onto your **character sheet,** to make sure that you can quickly reference your character’s abilities while playing.

## Getting Started

_Fonts of Power_ is best played in groups of 3-6.
After you’ve read this book, you’ll need a few additional items to play the game. Digital alternatives to these tools exist, and may be preferred by some:

- A copy of the **rules of the game,** found in this book.
- [Character sheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tNv3eBRoI_wg28S-e7h9KHyZcai-y-oS) with your characters’ statistics, [inventory](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hILGxE49G_lt8vIFywsUZDVPJ2MD4P0T) and features recorded.
- **Dice,** at least one each of standard size (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20). Multiple copies can be quite helpful for accelerating gameplay, and dice rolling tools are easy to find online.
- An **(erasable) battle mat** and **markers** to note terrain and designate created effects.
- Some sort of **tokens** which allow you to mark and distinguish the position of each character in combat. Figurines are fun and evocative, but even simple knickknacks such as differently colored buttons will work fine.

For the best gameplay experience, we also recommend:

- A copy of the _[Worldspeaker’s Guide to Fonts of Power](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WLBeS_Ei_BJYZnBafG6rWf7xODPFDSz8RQV2iA3WCU/edit#heading=h.zkka4gllffb)_ to help you build monsters, design encounters and tell better stories.

- [Cheatsheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/115pncBLyu_PtpFPgmCXF2LOHutthUhYLn0xDJPIL9Po/edit#) for commonly used rules.
- A convenient way to mark and change your character’s rapidly changing [vital statistics:](https://drive.google.com/open?id=141MsxVU0JBlb67CyoQ_aZ_Ga8CXMVyDb) life, essence, exhaustion, afflictions, ailments, and statuses.
- Separate **cards** describing your [gear,](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DsZxVKYwO6mc-q6Fowrd-bwsCVhCfL1_) [powers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y3N703iL99f6iO1cpXHesPzQRexWYnmH) and [actions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dLjHhAdqOU2Qi4KeSh9VPbkHZhdsTMf9) that your character has, to remind you of your options and capture how your features work when put together.
